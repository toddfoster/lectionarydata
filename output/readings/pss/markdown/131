_Domine, non est_

> 1	O LORD, I am not proud; \*  
> I have no haughty looks.  
> 2	I do not occupy myself with great matters, \*  
> or with things that are too hard for me.  
> 3	But I still my soul and make it quiet,  
> like a child upon its mother's breast; \*  
> my soul is quieted within me.  
> 4	O Israel, wait upon the LORD, \*  
> from this time forth for evermore.
