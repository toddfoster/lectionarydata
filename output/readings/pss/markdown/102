_Domine, exaudi_

> 1	LORD, hear my prayer, and let my cry come before you; \*  
> hide not your face from me in the day of my trouble.  
> 2	Incline your ear to me; \*  
> when I call, make haste to answer me,  
> 3	For my days drift away like smoke, \*  
> and my bones are hot as burning coals.  
> 4	My heart is smitten like grass and withered, \*  
> so that I forget to eat my bread.  
> 5	Because of the voice of my groaning \*  
> I am but skin and bones.  
> 6	I have become like a vulture in the wilderness, \*  
> like an owl among the ruins.  
> 7	I lie awake and groan; \*  
> I am like a sparrow, lonely on a house-top.  
> 8	My enemies revile me all day long, \*  
> and those who scoff at me have taken an oath against me.  
> 9	For I have eaten ashes for bread \*  
> and mingled my drink with weeping.  
> 10	Because of your indignation and wrath \*  
> you have lifted me up and thrown me away.  
> 11	My days pass away like a shadow, \*  
> and I wither like the grass.  
> 12	But you, O LORD, endure for ever, \*  
> and your Name from age to age.  
> 13	You will arise and have compassion on Zion,  
> for it is time to have mercy upon her; \*  
> indeed, the appointed time has come.  
> 14	For your servants love her very rubble, \*  
> and are moved to pity even for her dust.  
> 15	The nations shall fear your Name, O LORD, \*  
> and all the kings of the earth your glory.  
> 16	For the LORD will build up Zion, \*  
> and his glory will appear.  
> 17	He will look with favor on the prayer of the homeless; \*  
> he will not despise their plea.  
> 18	Let this be written for a future generation, \*  
> so that a people yet unborn may praise the LORD.  
> 19	For the LORD looked down from his holy place on high; \*  
> from the heavens he beheld the earth;  
> 20	That he might hear the groan of the captive \*  
> and set free those condemned to die;  
> 21	That they may declare in Zion the Name of the LORD, \*  
> and his praise in Jerusalem;  
> 22	When the peoples are gathered together, \*  
> and the kingdoms also, to serve the LORD.  
> 23	He has brought down my strength before my time; \*  
> he has shortened the number of my days;  
> 24	And I said, "O my God,  
> do not take me away in the midst of my days; \*  
> your years endure throughout all generations.  
> 25	In the beginning, O LORD, you laid the foundations of the earth, \*  
> and the heavens are the work of your hands;  
> 26	They shall perish, but you will endure;  
> they all shall wear out like a garment; \*  
> as clothing you will change them,  
> and they shall be changed;  
> 27	But you are always the same, \*  
> and your years will never end.  
> 28	The children of your servants shall continue, \*  
> and their offspring shall stand fast in your sight."
