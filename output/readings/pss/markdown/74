_Ut quid, Deus?_

> 1	O God, why have you utterly cast us off? \*  
> why is your wrath so hot against the sheep of your pasture?  
> 2	Remember your congregation that you purchased long ago, \*  
> the tribe you redeemed to be your inheritance,  
> and Mount Zion where you dwell.  
> 3	Turn your steps toward the endless ruins; \*  
> the enemy has laid waste everything in your sanctuary.  
> 4	Your adversaries roared in your holy place; \*  
> they set up their banners as tokens of victory.  
> 5	They were like men coming up with axes to a grove of trees; \*  
> they broke down all your carved work with hatchets and hammers.  
> 6	They set fire to your holy place; \*  
> they defiled the dwelling-place of your Name  
> and razed it to the ground.  
> 7	They said to themselves, "Let us destroy them altogether." \*  
> They burned down all the meeting-places of God in the land.  
> 8	There are no signs for us to see;  
> there is no prophet left; \*  
> there is not one among us who knows how long.  
> 9	How long, O God, will the adversary scoff? \*  
> will the enemy blaspheme your Name for ever?  
> 10	Why do you draw back your hand? \*  
> why is your right hand hidden in your bosom?  
> 11	Yet God is my King from ancient times, \*  
> victorious in the midst of the earth.  
> 12	You divided the sea by your might \*  
> and shattered the heads of the dragons upon the waters;  
> 13	You crushed the heads of Leviathan \*  
> and gave him to the people of the desert for food.  
> 14	You split open spring and torrent; \*  
> you dried up ever-flowing rivers.  
> 15	Yours is the day, yours also the night; \*  
> you established the moon and the sun.  
> 16	You fixed all the boundaries of the earth; \*  
> you made both summer and winter.  
> 17	Remember, O LORD, how the enemy scoffed, \*  
> how a foolish people despised your Name.  
> 18	Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; \*  
> never forget the lives of your poor.  
> 19	Look upon your covenant; \*  
> the dark places of the earth are haunts of violence.  
> 20	Let not the oppressed turn away ashamed; \*  
> let the poor and needy praise your Name.  
> 21	Arise, O God, maintain your cause; \*  
> remember how fools revile you all day long.  
> 22	Forget not the clamor of your adversaries, \*  
> the unending tumult of those who rise up against you.
