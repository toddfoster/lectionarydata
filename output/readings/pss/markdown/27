> 1	The LORD is my light and my salvation;  
> whom then shall I fear? \*  
> the LORD is the strength of my life;  
> of whom then shall I be afraid?  
> 2	When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, \*  
> it was they, my foes and my adversaries, who stumbled and fell.  
> 3	Though an army should encamp against me, \*  
> yet my heart shall not be afraid;  
> 4	And though war should rise up against me, \*  
> yet will I put my trust in him.  
> 5	One thing have I asked of the LORD;  
> one thing I seek; \*  
> that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days  
> of my life;  
> 6	To behold the fair beauty of the LORD \*  
> and to seek him in his temple.  
> 7	For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe in his shelter; \*  
> he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling  
> and set me high upon a rock.  
> 8	Even now he lifts up my head \*  
> above my enemies round about me.  
> 9	Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation  
> with sounds of great gladness; \*  
> I will sing and make music to the LORD.  
> 10	Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; \*  
> have mercy on me and answer me.  
> 11	You speak in my heart and say, "Seek my face." \*  
> Your face, LORD, will I seek.  
> 12	Hide not your face from me, \*  
> nor turn away your servant in displeasure.  
> 13	You have been my helper;  
> cast me not away; \*  
> do not forsake me, O God of my salvation.  
> 14	Though my father and my mother forsake me, \*  
> the LORD will sustain me.  
> 15	Show me your way, O LORD; \*  
> lead me on a level path, because of my enemies.  
> 16	Deliver me not into the hand of my adversaries, \*  
> for false witnesses have risen up against me,  
> and also those who speak malice.  
> 17	What if I had not believed  
> that I should see the goodness of the LORD \*  
> in the land of the living!  
> 18	O tarry and await the LORD'S pleasure;  
> be strong, and he shall comfort your heart; \*  
> wait patiently for the LORD.
