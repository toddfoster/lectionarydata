_Domine, clamavi_

> 1	O LORD, I call to you; come to me quickly; \*  
> hear my voice when I cry to you.  
> 2	Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, \*  
> the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.  
> 3	Set a watch before my mouth, O LORD,  
> and guard the door of my lips; \*  
> let not my heart incline to any evil thing.  
> 4	Let me not be occupied in wickedness with evildoers, \*  
> nor eat of their choice foods.  
> 5	Let the righteous smite me in friendly rebuke;  
> let not the oil of the unrighteous anoint my head; \*  
> for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.  
> 6	Let their rulers be overthrown in stony places, \*  
> that they may know my words are true.  
> 7	As when a plowman turns over the earth in furrows, \*  
> let their bones be scattered at the mouth of the grave.  
> 8	But my eyes are turned to you, Lord GOD; \*  
> in you I take refuge;  
> do not strip me of my life.  
> 9	Protect me from the snare which they have laid for me \*  
> and from the traps of the evildoers.  
> 10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, \*  
> while I myself escape.
