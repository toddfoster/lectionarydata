_Domine, quid multiplicati_

> 1	LORD, how many adversaries I have! \*  
> how many there are who rise up against me!  
> 2	How many there are who say of me, \*  
> "There is no help for him in his God."  
> 3	But you, O LORD, are a shield about me; \*  
> you are my glory, the one who lifts up my head.  
> 4	I call aloud upon the LORD, \*  
> and he answers me from his holy hill;  
> 5	I lie down and go to sleep; \*  
> I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.  
> 6	I do not fear the multitudes of people \*  
> who set themselves against me all around.  
> 7	Rise up, O LORD; set me free, O my God; \*  
> surely, you will strike all my enemies across the face,  
> you will break the teeth of the wicked.  
> 8	Deliverance belongs to the LORD. \*  
> Your blessing be upon your people!
