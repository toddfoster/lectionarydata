_Domine, in virtute tua_

> 1	The king rejoices in your strength, O LORD; \*  
> how greatly he exults in your victory!  
> 2	You have given him his heart's desire; \*  
> you have not denied him the request of his lips.  
> 3	For you meet him with blessings of prosperity, \*  
> and set a crown of fine gold upon his head.  
> 4	He asked you for life, and you gave it to him: \*  
> length of days, for ever and ever.  
> 5	His honor is great, because of your victory; \*  
> splendor and majesty have you bestowed upon him.  
> 6	For you will give him everlasting felicity \*  
> and will make him glad with the joy of your presence.  
> 7	For the king puts his trust in the LORD; \*  
> because of the loving-kindness of the Most High, he will not fall.  
> 8	Your hand will lay hold upon all your enemies; \*  
> your right hand will seize all those who hate you.  
> 9	You will make them like a fiery furnace \*  
> at the time of your appearing, O LORD;  
> 10	You will swallow them up in your wrath, \*  
> and fire shall consume them.  
> 11	You will destroy their offspring from the land \*  
> and their descendants from among the peoples of the earth.  
> 12	Though they intend evil against you  
> and devise wicked schemes, \*  
> yet they shall not prevail.  
> 13	For you will put them to flight \*  
> and aim your arrows at them.  
> 14	Be exalted, O LORD, in your might; \*  
> we will sing and praise your power.
