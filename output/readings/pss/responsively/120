_Ad Dominum_

> 1	When I was in trouble, I called to the LORD; \*  
I called to the LORD, and he answered me.  
> **2	Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips \*  
and from the deceitful tongue.**  
  
> 3	What shall be done to you, and what more besides, \*  
O you deceitful tongue?  
> **4	The sharpened arrows of a warrior, \*  
along with hot glowing coals.**  
  
> 5	How hateful it is that I must lodge in Meshech \*  
and dwell among the tents of Kedar!  
> **6	Too long have I had to live \*  
among the enemies of peace.**  
  
> 7	I am on the side of peace, \*  
but when I speak of it, they are for war.
