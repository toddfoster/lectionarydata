_Quid gloriaris?_

> 1	You tyrant, why do you boast of wickedness \*  
against the godly all day long?  
> **2	You plot ruin;  
your tongue is like a sharpened razor, \*  
O worker of deception.**  
  
> 3	You love evil more than good \*  
and lying more than speaking the truth.  
> **4	You love all words that hurt, \*  
O you deceitful tongue.**  
  
> 5	Oh, that God would demolish you utterly, \*  
topple you, and snatch you from your dwelling,  
and root you out of the land of the living!  
> **6	The righteous shall see and tremble, \*  
and they shall laugh at him, saying,**  
  
> 7	"This is the one who did not take God for a refuge, \*  
but trusted in great wealth  
and relied upon wickedness."  
> **8	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; \*  
I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.**  
  
> 9	I will give you thanks for what you have done \*  
and declare the goodness of your Name in the presence of the godly.
