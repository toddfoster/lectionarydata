_Fundamenta ejus_

> 1	On the holy mountain stands the city he has founded; \*  
the LORD loves the gates of Zion  
more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  
> **2	Glorious things are spoken of you, \*  
O city of our God.**  
  
> 3	I count Egypt and Babylon among those who know me; \*  
behold Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia:  
in Zion were they born.  
> **4	Of Zion it shall be said, "Everyone was born in her, \*  
and the Most High himself shall sustain her."**  
  
> 5	The LORD will record as he enrolls the peoples, \*  
"These also were born there."  
> **6	The singers and the dancers will say, \*  
"All my fresh springs are in you."**
