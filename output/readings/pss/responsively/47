_Omnes gentes, plaudite_

> 1	Clap your hands, all you peoples; \*  
shout to God with a cry of joy.  
> **2	For the LORD Most High is to be feared; \*  
he is the great King over all the earth.**  
  
> 3	He subdues the peoples under us, \*  
and the nations under our feet.  
> **4	He chooses our inheritance for us, \*  
the pride of Jacob whom he loves.**  
  
> 5	God has gone up with a shout, \*  
the LORD with the sound of the ram's-horn.  
> **6	Sing praises to God, sing praises; \*  
sing praises to our King, sing praises.**  
  
> 7	For God is King of all the earth; \*  
sing praises with all your skill.  
> **8	God reigns over the nations; \*  
God sits upon his holy throne.**  
  
> 9	The nobles of the peoples have gathered together \*  
with the people of the God of Abraham.  
> **10	The rulers of the earth belong to God, \*  
and he is highly exalted.**
