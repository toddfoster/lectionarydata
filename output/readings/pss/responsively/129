_Sœpe expugnaverunt_

> 1	"Greatly have they oppressed me since my youth," \*  
let Israel now say;  
> **2	"Greatly have they oppressed me since my youth, \*  
but they have not prevailed against me."**  
  
> 3	The plowmen plowed upon my back \*  
and made their furrows long.  
> **4	The LORD, the Righteous One, \*  
has cut the cords of the wicked.**  
  
> 5	Let them be put to shame and thrown back, \*  
all those who are enemies of Zion.  
> **6	Let them be like grass upon the housetops, \*  
which withers before it can be plucked;**  
  
> 7	Which does not fill the hand of the reaper, \*  
nor the bosom of him who binds the sheaves;  
> **8	So that those who go by say not so much as,  
"The LORD prosper you. \*  
We wish you well in the Name of the LORD."**
