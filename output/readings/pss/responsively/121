_Levavi oculos_

> 1	I lift up my eyes to the hills; \*  
from where is my help to come?  
> **2	My help comes from the LORD, \*  
the maker of heaven and earth.**  
  
> 3	He will not let your foot be moved \*  
and he who watches over you will not fall asleep.  
> **4	Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel \*  
shall neither slumber nor sleep;**  
  
> 5	The LORD himself watches over you; \*  
the LORD is your shade at your right hand,  
> **6	So that the sun shall not strike you by day, \*  
nor the moon by night.**  
  
> 7	The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; \*  
it is he who shall keep you safe.  
> **8	The LORD shall watch over your going out and your coming in, \*  
from this time forth for evermore.**
