_Eripe me, Domine_

> 1	Deliver me, O LORD, from evildoers; \*  
protect me from the violent,  
> **2	Who devise evil in their hearts \*  
and stir up strife all day long.**  
  
> 3	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; \*  
adder's poison is under their lips.  
> **4	Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; \*  
protect me from the violent,  
who are determined to trip me up.**  
  
> 5	The proud have hidden a snare for me  
and stretched out a net of cords; \*  
they have set traps for me along the path.  
> **6	I have said to the LORD, "You are my God; \*  
listen, O LORD, to my supplication.**  
  
> 7	O Lord GOD, the strength of my salvation, \*  
you have covered my head in the day of battle.  
> **8	Do not grant the desires of the wicked, O LORD, \*  
nor let their evil plans prosper.**  
  
> 9	Let not those who surround me lift up their heads; \*  
let the evil of their lips overwhelm them.  
> **10	Let hot burning coals fall upon them; \*  
let them be cast into the mire, never to rise up again."**  
  
> 11	A slanderer shall not be established on the earth, \*  
and evil shall hunt down the lawless.  
> **12	I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the poor \*  
and render justice to the needy.**  
  
> 13	Surely, the righteous will give thanks to your Name, \*  
and the upright shall continue in your sight.
