_Quare fremuerunt gentes?_

> 1	Why are the nations in an uproar? \*  
Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?  
> **2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,  
and the princes plot together, \*  
against the LORD and against his Anointed?**  
  
> 3	"Let us break their yoke," they say; \*  
"let us cast off their bonds from us."  
> **4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; \*  
the Lord has them in derision.**  
  
> 5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, \*  
and his rage fills them with terror.  
> **6	"I myself have set my king \*  
upon my holy hill of Zion."**  
  
> 7	Let me announce the decree of the LORD: \*  
he said to me, "You are my Son;  
this day have I begotten you.  
> **8	Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for  
your inheritance \*  
and the ends of the earth for your possession.**  
  
> 9	You shall crush them with an iron rod \*  
and shatter them like a piece of pottery."  
> **10	And now, you kings, be wise; \*  
be warned, you rulers of the earth.**  
  
> 11	Submit to the LORD with fear, \*  
and with trembling bow before him;  
> **12	Lest he be angry and you perish; \*  
for his wrath is quickly kindled.**  
  
> 13	Happy are they all \*  
who take refuge in him!
