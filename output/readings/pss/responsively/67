_Deus misereatur_

> 1	May God be merciful to us and bless us, \*  
show us the light of his countenance and come to us.  
> **2	Let your ways be known upon earth, \*  
your saving health among all nations.**  
  
> 3	Let the peoples praise you, O God; \*  
let all the peoples praise you.  
> **4	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, \*  
for you judge the peoples with equity  
and guide all the nations upon earth.**  
  
> 5	Let the peoples praise you, O God; \*  
let all the peoples praise you.  
> **6	The earth has brought forth her increase; \*  
may God, our own God, give us his blessing.**  
  
> 7	May God give us his blessing, \*  
and may all the ends of the earth stand in awe of him.
