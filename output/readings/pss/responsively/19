_Caeli enarrant_

> 1	The heavens declare the glory of God, \*  
and the firmament shows his handiwork.  
> **2	One day tells its tale to another, \*  
and one night imparts knowledge to another.**  
  
> 3	Although they have no words or language, \*  
and their voices are not heard,  
> **4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, \*  
and their message to the ends of the world.**  
  
> 5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; \*  
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;  
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.  
> **6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens  
and runs about to the end of it again; \*  
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.**  
  
> 7	The law of the LORD is perfect  
and revives the soul; \*  
the testimony of the LORD is sure  
and gives wisdom to the innocent.  
> **8	The statutes of the LORD are just  
and rejoice the heart; \*  
the commandment of the LORD is clear  
and gives light to the eyes.**  
  
> 9	The fear of the LORD is clean  
and endures for ever; \*  
the judgments of the LORD are true  
and righteous altogether.  
> **10	More to be desired are they than gold,  
more than much fine gold, \*  
sweeter far than honey,  
than honey in the comb.**  
  
> 11	By them also is your servant enlightened, \*  
and in keeping them there is great reward.  
> **12	Who can tell how often he offends? \*  
cleanse me from my secret faults.**  
  
> 13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;  
let them not get dominion over me; \*  
then shall I be whole and sound,  
and innocent of a great offense.  
> **14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart  
be acceptable in your sight, \*  
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.**
