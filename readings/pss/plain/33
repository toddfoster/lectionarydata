_Exultate, justi_
1	Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; *
it is good for the just to sing praises.
2	Praise the LORD with the harp; *
play to him upon the psaltery and lyre.
3	Sing for him a new song; *
sound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet.
4	For the word of the LORD is right, *
and all his works are sure.
5	He loves righteousness and justice; *
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.
6	By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, *
by the breath of his mouth all the heavenly hosts.
7	He gathers up the waters of the ocean as in a water-skin *
and stores up the depths of the sea.
8	Let all the earth fear the LORD; *
let all who dwell in the world stand in awe of him.
9	For he spoke, and it came to pass; *
he commanded, and it stood fast.
10	The LORD brings the will of the nations to naught; *
he thwarts the designs of the peoples.
11	But the LORD'S will stands fast for ever, *
and the designs of his heart from age to age.
12	Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! *
happy the people he has chosen to be his own!
13	The LORD looks down from heaven, *
and beholds all the people in the world.
14	From where he sits enthroned he turns his gaze *
on all who dwell on the earth.
15	He fashions all the hearts of them *
and understands all their works.
16	There is no king that can be saved by a mighty army; *
a strong man is not delivered by his great strength.
17	The horse is a vain hope for deliverance; *
for all its strength it cannot save.
18	Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, *
on those who wait upon his love,
19	To pluck their lives from death, *
and to feed them in time of famine.
20	Our soul waits for the LORD; *
he is our help and our shield.
21	Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, *
for in his holy Name we put our trust.
22	Let your loving-kindness, O LORD, be upon us, *
as we have put our trust in you.
