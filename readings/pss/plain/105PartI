_Confitemini Domino_
1	Give thanks to the LORD and call upon his Name; *
make known his deeds among the peoples.
2	Sing to him, sing praises to him, *
and speak of all his marvelous works.
3	Glory in his holy Name; *
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
4	Search for the LORD and his strength; *
continually seek his face.
5	Remember the marvels he has done, *
his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,
6	O offspring of Abraham his servant, *
O children of Jacob his chosen.
7	He is the LORD our God; *
his judgments prevail in all the world.
8	He has always been mindful of his covenant, *
the promise he made for a thousand generations:
9	The covenant he made with Abraham, *
the oath that he swore to Issac,
10	Which he established as a statute for Jacob, *
an everlasting covenant for Israel,
11	Saying, "To you will I give the land of Canaan *
to be your allotted inheritance."
12	When they were few in number, *
of little account, and sojourners in the land,
13	Wandering from nation to nation *
and from one kingdom to another,
14	He let no one oppress them *
and rebuked kings for their sake,
15	Saying, "Do not touch my anointed *
and do my prophets no harm."
16	Then he called for a famine in the land *
and destroyed the supply of bread.
17	He sent a man before them, *
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
18	They bruised his feet in fetters; *
his neck they put in an iron collar.
19	Until his prediction came to pass, *
the word of the LORD tested him.
20	The king sent and released him; *
the ruler of the peoples set him free.
21	He set him as a master over his household, *
as a ruler over all his possessions,
22	To instruct his princes according to his will *
and to teach his elders wisdom.
