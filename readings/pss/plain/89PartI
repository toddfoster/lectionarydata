_Misericordias Domini_
1	Your love, O LORD, for ever will I sing; *
from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.
2	For I am persuaded that your love is established for ever; *
you have set your faithfulness firmly in the heavens.
3	"I have made a covenant with my chosen one; *
I have sworn an oath to David my servant:
4	'I will establish your line for ever, *
and preserve your throne for all generations.'"
5	The heavens bear witness to your wonders, O LORD, *
and to your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones;
6	For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? *
who is like the LORD among the gods?
7	God is much to be feared in the council of the holy ones, *
great and terrible to all those round about him.
8	Who is like you, LORD God of hosts? *
O mighty LORD, your faithfulness is all around you.
9	You rule the raging of the sea *
and still the surging of its waves.
10	You have crushed Rahab of the deep with a deadly wound; *
you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
11	Yours are the heavens; the earth also is yours; *
you laid the foundations of the world and all that is in it.
12	You have made the north and the south; *
Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your Name.
13	You have a mighty arm; *
strong is your hand and high is your right hand.
14	Righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne; *
love and truth go before your face.
15	Happy are the people who know the festal shout! *
they walk, O LORD, in the light of your presence.
16	They rejoice daily in your Name; *
they are jubilant in your righteousness.
17	For you are the glory of their strength, *
and by your favor our might is exalted.
18	Truly, the LORD is our ruler; *
The Holy One of Israel is our King.
