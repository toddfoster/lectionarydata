_Exaudi, Deus_
1	Hear my prayer,O God; *
do not hide yourself from my petition.
2	Listen to me and answer me; *
I have no peace, because of my cares.
3	I am shaken by the noise of the enemy *
and by the pressure of the wicked;
4	For they have cast an evil spell upon me *
and are set against me in fury.
5	My heart quakes within me, *
and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
6	Fear and trembling have come over me, *
and horror overwhelms me.
7	And I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! *
I would fly away and be at rest.
8	I would flee to a far-off place *
and make my lodging in the wilderness.
9	I would hasten to escape *
from the stormy wind and tempest."
10	Swallow them up, O Lord;
confound their speech; *
for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
11	Day and night the watchmen make their rounds
upon her walls, *
but trouble and misery are in the midst of her.
12	There is corruption at her heart; *
her streets are never free of oppression and deceit.
13	For had it been an adversary who taunted me,
then I could have borne it; *
or had it been an enemy who vaunted himself against me,
then I could have hidden from him.
14	But it was you, a man after my own heart, *
my companion, my own familiar friend.
15	We took sweet counsel together, *
and walked with the throng in the house of God.
16	Let death come upon them suddenly;
let them go down alive to the grave; *
for wickedness is in their dwellings, in their very midst.
17	But I will call upon God, *
and the LORD will deliver me.
18	In the evening, in the morning, and at noonday,
I will complain and lament, *
and he will hear my voice.
19	He will bring me safely back from the battle
waged against me; *
for there are many who fight me.
20	God, who is enthroned of old, will hear me and
bring them down; *
they never change; they do not fear God.
21	My companion stretched forth his hand against his comrade; *
he has broken his covenant.
22	His speech is softer than butter, *
but war is in his heart.
23	His words are smoother than oil, *
but they are drawn swords.
24	Cast your burden upon the LORD,
and he will sustain you; *
he will never let the righteous stumble.
25	For you will bring the bloodthirsty and deceitful *
down to the pit of destruction, O God.
26	They shall not live out half their days, *
but I will put my trust in you.
