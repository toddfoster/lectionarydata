_Beatus vir qui non abiit_
1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of
the wicked, *
nor lingered in the way of sinners,
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!
2	Their delight is in the law of the LORD, *
and they meditate on his law day and night.
3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither; *
everything they do shall prosper.
4	It is not so with the wicked; *
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.
5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when
judgment comes, *
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.
6	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, *
but the way of the wicked is doomed.
