_Magnus Dominus_
1	Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; *
in the city of our God is his holy hill.
2	Beautiful and lofty, the joy of all the earth, is the
hill of Zion, *
the very center of the world and the city of the great King.
3	God is in her citadels; *
he is known to be her sure refuge.
4	Behold, the kings of the earth assembled *
and marched forward together.
5	They looked and were astounded; *
they retreated and fled in terror.
6	Trembling seized them there; *
they writhed like a woman in childbirth,
like ships of the sea when the east wind shatters them.
7	As we have heard, so have we seen,
in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; *
God has established her for ever.
8	We have waited in silence on your loving-kindness, O God, *
in the midst of your temple.
9	Your praise, like your Name, O God, reaches to
the world's end; *
your right hand is full of justice.
10	Let Mount Zion be glad
and the cities of Judah rejoice, *
because of your judgments.
11	Make the circuit of Zion;
walk round about her; *
count the number of her towers.
12	Consider well her bulwarks;
examine her strongholds; *
that you may tell those who come after.
13	This God is our God for ever and ever; *
he shall be our guide for evermore.
