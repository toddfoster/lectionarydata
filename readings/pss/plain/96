_Cantate Domino_
1	Sing to the LORD a new song; *
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.
2	Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.
3	Declare his glory among the nations *
and his wonders among all peoples.
4	For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *
he is more to be feared than all gods.
5	As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.
6	Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!
7	Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; *
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.
8	Ascribe to the LORD the honor due his Name; *
bring offerings and come into his courts.
9	Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; *
let the whole earth tremble before him.
10	Tell it out among the nations: "The LORD is King! *
he has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;
he will judge the peoples with equity."
11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;
let the sea thunder and all that is in it; *
let the field be joyful and all that is therein.
12	Then shall all the trees of the wood shout for joy
before the LORD when he comes, *
when he comes to judge the earth.
13	He will judge the world with righteousness *
and the peoples with his truth.
