**Part II**
_Posuit flumina_
33	The LORD changed rivers into deserts, *
and water-springs into thirsty ground,
34	A fruitful land into salt flats, *
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
35	He changed deserts into pools of water *
and dry land into water-springs.
36	He settled the hungry there, *
and they founded a city to dwell in.
37	They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, *
and brought in a fruitful harvest.
38	He blessed them, so that they increased greatly; *
he did not let their herds decrease.
39	Yet when they were diminished and brought low, *
through stress of adversity and sorrow,
40	(He pours contempt on princes *
and makes them wander in trackless wastes)
41	He lifted up the poor out of misery *
and multiplied their families like flocks of sheep.
42	The upright will see this and rejoice, *
but all wickedness will shut its mouth.
43	Whoever is wise will ponder these things, *
and consider well the mercies of the LORD.
