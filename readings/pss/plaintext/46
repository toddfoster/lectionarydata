Deus noster refugium
1	God is our refuge and strength, *
a very present help in trouble.
2	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be moved, *
and though the mountains be toppled into the
depths of the sea;
3	Though its waters rage and foam, *
and though the mountains tremble at its tumult.
4	The LORD of hosts is with us; *
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.
5	There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, *
the holy habitation of the Most High.
6	God is in the midst of her;
she shall not be overthrown; *
God shall help her at the break of day.
7	The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are shaken; *
God has spoken, and the earth shall melt away.
8	The LORD of hosts is with us; *
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.
9	Come now and look upon the works of the LORD, *
what awesome things he has done on earth.
10	It is he who makes war to cease in all the world; *
he breaks the bow, and shatters the spear,
and burns the shields with fire.
11	"Be still, then, and know that I am God; *
I will be exalted among the nations;
I will be exalted in the earth."
12	The LORD of hosts is with us; *
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.
