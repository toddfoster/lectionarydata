_Deus, Deus meu_

> 1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? \*  
> and are so far from my cry  
> and from the words of my distress?  
> 2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; \*  
> by night as well, but I find no rest.  
> 3	Yet you are the Holy One, \*  
> enthroned upon the praises of Israel.  
> 4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; \*  
> they trusted, and you delivered them.  
> 5	They cried out to you and were delivered; \*  
> they trusted in you and were not put to shame.  
> 6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, \*  
> scorned by all and despised by the people.  
> 7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; \*  
> they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,  
> 8	"He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; \*  
> let him rescue him, if he delights in him."  
> 9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, \*  
> and kept me safe upon my mother's breast.  
> 10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; \*  
> you were my God when I was still in my mother's womb.  
> 11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, \*  
> and there is none to help.  
> 12	Many young bulls encircle me; \*  
> strong bulls of Bashan surround me.  
> 13	They open wide their jaws at me, \*  
> like a ravening and a roaring lion.  
> 14	I am poured out like water;  
> all my bones are out of joint; \*  
> my heart within my breast is melting wax.  
> 15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;  
> my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; \*  
> and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.  
> 16	Packs of dogs close me in,  
> and gangs of evildoers circle around me; \*  
> they pierce my hands and my feet;  
> I can count all my bones.  
> 17	They stare and gloat over me; \*  
> they divide my garments among them;  
> they cast lots for my clothing.  
> 18	Be not far away, O LORD; \*  
> you are my strength; hasten to help me.  
> 19	Save me from the sword, \*  
> my life from the power of the dog.  
> 20	Save me from the lion's mouth, \*  
> my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.  
> 21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; \*  
> in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.  
> 22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; \*  
> stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;  
> all you of Jacob's line, give glory.  
> 23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;  
> neither does he hide his face from them; \*  
> but when they cry to him he hears them.  
> 24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; \*  
> I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.  
> 25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,  
> and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: \*  
> "May your heart live for ever!"  
> 26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, \*  
> and all the families of the nations bow before him.  
> 27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; \*  
> he rules over the nations.  
> 28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; \*  
> all who go down to the dust fall before him.  
> 29	My soul shall live for him;  
> my descendants shall serve him; \*  
> they shall be known as the LORD'S for ever.  
> 30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn \*  
> the saving deeds that he has done.
