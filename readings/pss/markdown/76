_Notus in Judœa_

> 1	In Judah is God known; *
> his Name is great in Israel.
> 2	At Salem is his tabernacle, *
> and his dwelling is in Zion.
> 3	There he broke the flashing arrows, *
> the shield, the sword, and the weapons of battle.
> 4	How glorious you are! *
> more splendid than the everlasting mountains!
> 5	The strong of heart have been despoiled;
> they sink into sleep; *
> none of the warriors can lift a hand.
> 6	At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, *
> both horse and rider lie stunned.
> 7	What terror you inspire! *
> who can stand before you when you are angry?
> 8	From heaven you pronounced judgment; *
> the earth was afraid and was still;
> 9	When God rose up to judgment *
> and to save all the oppressed of the earth.
> 10	Truly, wrathful Edom will give you thanks, *
> and the remnant of Hamath will keep your feasts.
> 11	Make a vow to the LORD your God and keep it; *
> let all around him bring gifts to him who is worthy to be feared.
> 12	He breaks the spirit of princes, *
> and strikes terror in the kings of the earth.
