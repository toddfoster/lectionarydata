_Qui habitat_

> 1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, \*  
> abides under the shadow of the Almighty.  
> 2	He shall say to the LORD,  
> "You are my refuge and my stronghold, \*  
> my God in whom I put my trust."  
> 3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter \*  
> and from the deadly pestilence.  
> 4	He shall cover you with his pinions,  
> and you shall find refuge under his wings; \*  
> his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.  
> 5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, \*  
> nor of the arrow that flies by day;  
> 6	Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, \*  
> nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.  
> 7	A thousand shall fall at your side  
> and ten thousand at your right hand, \*  
> but it shall not come near you.  
> 8	Your eyes have only to behold \*  
> to see the reward of the wicked.  
> 9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, \*  
> and the Most High your habitation,  
> 10	There shall no evil happen to you, \*  
> neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.  
> 11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, \*  
> to keep you in all your ways.  
> 12	They shall bear you in their hands, \*  
> lest you dash your foot against a stone.  
> 13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; \*  
> you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.  
> 14	Because he is bound to me in love,  
> therefore will I deliver him; \*  
> I will protect him, because he knows my Name.  
> 15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; \*  
> I am with him in trouble;  
> I will rescue him and bring him to honor.  
> 16	With long life will I satisfy him, \*  
> and show him my salvation.
