_Nisi quia Dominus_

> 1	If the LORD had not been on our side, \*  
> let Israel now say;  
> 2	If the LORD had not been on our side, \*  
> when enemies rose up against us;  
> 3	Then would they have swallowed us up alive \*  
> in their fierce anger toward us;  
> 4	Then would the waters have overwhelmed us \*  
> and the torrent gone over us;  
> 5	Then would the raging waters \*  
> have gone right over us.  
> 6	Blessed be the LORD! \*  
> he has not given us over to be a prey for their teeth.  
> 7	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; \*  
> the snare is broken, and we have escaped.  
> 8	Our help is in the Name of the LORD, \*  
> the maker of heaven and earth.
