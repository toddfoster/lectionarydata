_Deus stetit_

> 1	God takes his stand in the council of heaven; \*  
> he gives judgment in the midst of the gods:  
> 2	"How long will you judge unjustly, \*  
> and show favor to the wicked?  
> 3	Save the weak and the orphan; \*  
> defend the humble and needy;  
> 4	Rescue the weak and the poor; \*  
> deliver them from the power of the wicked.  
> 5	They do not know, neither do they understand;  
> they go about in darkness; \*  
> all the foundations of the earth are shaken.  
> 6	Now I say to you, 'You are gods, \*  
> and all of you children of the Most High;  
> 7	Nevertheless, you shall die like mortals, \*  
> and fall like any prince.'"  
> 8	Arise, O God, and rule the earth, \*  
> for you shall take all nations for your own.
