_Eripe me de inimicis_

> 1	Rescue me from my enemies, O God; *
> protect me from those who rise up against me.
> 2	Rescue me from evildoers *
> and save me from those who thirst for my blood.
> 3	See how they lie in wait for my life,
> how the mighty gather together against me; *
> not for any offense or fault of mine, O LORD.
> 4	Not because of any guilt of mine *
> they run and prepare themselves for battle.
> 5	Rouse yourself, come to my side, and see; *
> for you, LORD God of hosts, are Israel's God.
> 6	Awake, and punish all the ungodly; *
> show no mercy to those who are faithless and evil.
> 7	They go to and fro in the evening; *
> they snarl like dogs and run about the city.
> 8	Behold, they boast with their mouths,
> and taunts are on their lips; *
> "For who," they say, "will hear us?"
> 9	But you, O LORD, you laugh at them; *
> you laugh all the ungodly to scorn.
> 10	My eyes are fixed on you, O my Strength; *
> for you, O God, are my stronghold.
> 11	My merciful God comes to meet me; *
> God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
> 12	Slay them, O God, lest my people forget; *
> send them reeling by your might
> and put them down, O Lord our shield.
> 13	For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips,
> for the cursing and lies that they utter, *
> let them be caught in their pride.
> 14	Make an end of them in your wrath; *
> make an end of them, and they shall be no more.
> 15	Let everyone know that God rules in Jacob, *
> and to the ends of the earth.
> 16	They go to and fro in the evening; *
> they snarl like dogs and run about the city.
> 17	They forage for food, *
> and if they are not filled, they howl.
> 18	For my part, I will sing of your strength; *
> I will celebrate your love in the morning;
> 19	For you have become my stronghold, *
> a refuge in the day of my trouble.
> 20	To you, O my Strength, will I sing; *
> for you, O God, are my stronghold and my merciful God.
