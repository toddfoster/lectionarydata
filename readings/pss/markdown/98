> has he won for himself the victory.
> 3	The LORD has made known his victory; *
> his righteousness has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.
> 4	He remembers his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel, *
> and all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.
> 5	Shout with joy to the LORD, all you lands; *
> lift up your voice, rejoice, and sing.
> 6	Sing to the LORD with the harp, *
> with the harp and the voice of song.
> 7	With trumpets and the sound of the horn *
> shout with joy before the King, the LORD.
> 8	Let the sea make a noise and all that is in it, *
> the lands and those who dwell therein.
> 9	Let the rivers clap their hands, *
> and let the hills ring out with joy before the LORD,
> when he comes to judge the earth.
> 10	In righteousness shall he judge the world *
> and the peoples with equity.
