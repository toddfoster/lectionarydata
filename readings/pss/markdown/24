_Domini est terra_

> 1	The earth is the LORD'S and all that is in it, *
> the world and all who dwell therein.
> 2	For it is he who founded it upon the seas *
> and made it firm upon the rivers of the deep.
> 3	"Who can ascend the hill of the LORD? *
> and who can stand in his holy place?"
> 4	"Those who have clean hands and a pure heart, *
> who have not pledged themselves to falsehood,
> nor sworn by what is a fraud.
> 5	They shall receive a blessing from the LORD *
> and a just reward from the God of their salvation."
> 6	Such is the generation of those who seek him, *
> of those who seek your face, O God of Jacob.
> 7	Lift up your heads, O gates;
> lift them high, O everlasting doors; *
> and the King of glory shall come in.
> 8	"Who is this King of glory?" *
> "The LORD, strong and mighty,
> the LORD, mighty in battle."
> 9	Lift up your heads, O gates;
> lift them high, O everlasting doors; *
> and the King of glory shall come in.
> 10	"Who is he, this King of glory?" *
> "The LORD of hosts,
> he is the King of glory."
