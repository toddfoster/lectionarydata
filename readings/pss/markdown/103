_Benedic, anima mea_

> 1	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *
> and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.
> 2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *
> and forget not all his benefits.
> 3	He forgives all your sins *
> and heals all your infirmities;
> 4	He redeems your life from the grave *
> and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;
> 5	He satisfies you with good things, *
> and your youth is renewed like an eagle's.
> 6	The LORD executes righteousness *
> and judgment for all who are oppressed.
> 7	He made his ways known to Moses *
> and his works to the children of Israel.
> 8	The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, *
> slow to anger and of great kindness.
> 9	He will not always accuse us, *
> nor will he keep his anger for ever.
> 10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, *
> nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.
> 11	For as the heavens are high above the earth, *
> so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.
> 12	As far as the east is from the west, *
> so far has he removed our sins from us.
> 13	As a father cares for his children, *
> so does the LORD care for those who fear him.
> 14	For he himself knows whereof we are made; *
> he remembers that we are but dust.
> 15	Our days are like the grass; *
> we flourish like a flower of the field;
> 16	When the wind goes over it, it is gone, *
> and its place shall know it no more.
> 17	But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever
> on those who fear him, *
> and his righteousness on children's children;
> 18	On those who keep his covenant *
> and remember his commandments and do them.
> 19	The LORD has set his throne in heaven, *
> and his kingship has dominion over all.
> 20	Bless the LORD, you angels of his,
> you mighty ones who do his bidding, *
> and hearken to the voice of his word.
> 21	Bless the LORD, all you his hosts, *
> you ministers of his who do his will.
> 22	Bless the LORD, all you works of his,
> in all places of his dominion; *
> bless the LORD, O my soul.
