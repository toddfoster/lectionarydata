_Exaltabo te, Domine_

> 1	I will exalt you, O LORD,
> because you have lifted me up *
> and have not let my enemies triumph over me.
> 2	O LORD my God, I cried out to you, *
> and you restored me to health.
> 3	You brought me up, O LORD, from the dead; *
> you restored my life as I was going down to the grave.
> 4	Sing to the LORD, you servants of his; *
> give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness.
> 5	For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, *
> his favor for a lifetime.
> 6	Weeping may spend the night, *
> but joy comes in the morning.
> 7	While I felt secure, I said,
> I shall never be disturbed. *
> You, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as
> the mountains."
> 8	Then you hid your face, *
> and I was filled with fear.
> 9	I cried to you, O LORD; *
> I pleaded with the Lord, saying,
> 10	"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit? *
> will the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?
> 11	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *
> O LORD, be my helper."
> 12	You have turned my wailing into dancing; *
> you have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy.
> 13	Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing; *
> O LORD my God, I will give you thanks for ever.
