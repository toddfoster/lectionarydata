_In te, Domine, speravi_

> 1	In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; *
> let me never be ashamed.
> 2	In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *
> incline your ear to me and save me.
> 3	Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *
> you are my crag and my stronghold.
> 4	Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *
> from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.
> 5	For you are my hope, O LORD God, *
> my confidence since I was young.
> 6	I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;
> from my mother's womb you have been my strength; *
> my praise shall be always of you.
> 7	I have become a portent to many; *
> but you are my refuge and my strength.
> 8	Let my mouth be full of your praise *
> and your glory all the day long.
> 9	Do not cast me off in my old age; *
> forsake me not when my strength fails.
> 10	For my enemies are talking against me, *
> and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.
> 11	They say, "God has forsaken him;
> go after him and seize him; *
> because there is none who will save."
> 12	O God, be not far from me; *
> come quickly to help me, O my God.
> 13	Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; *
> let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn
> and reproach.
> 14	But I shall always wait in patience, *
> and shall praise you more and more.
> 15	My mouth shall recount your mighty acts
> and saving deeds all day long; *
> though I cannot know the number of them.
> 16	I will begin with the mighty works of the Lord GOD; *
> I will recall your righteousness, yours alone.
> 17	O God, you have taught me since I was young, *
> and to this day I tell of your wonderful works.
> 18	And now that I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not forsake me, *
> till I make known your strength to this generation
> and your power to all who are to come.
> 19	Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens; *
> you have done great things;
> who is like you, O God?
> 20	You have showed me great troubles and adversities, *
> but you will restore my life
> and bring me up again from the deep places of the earth.
> 21	You strengthen me more and more; *
> you enfold and comfort me,
> 22	Therefore I will praise you upon the lyre for your faithfulness, O my God; *
> I will sing to you with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
> 23	My lips will sing with joy when I play to you, *
> and so will my soul, which you have redeemed.
> 24	My tongue will proclaim your righteousness all day long, *
> for they are ashamed and disgraced who sought to do me harm.
