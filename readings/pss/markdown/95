_Venite, exultemus_

> 1	Come, let us sing to the LORD; *
> let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.
> 2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *
> and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.
> 3	For the LORD is a great God, *
> and a great King above all gods.
> 4	In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *
> and the heights of the hills are his also.
> 5	The sea is his, for he made it, *
> and his hands have molded the dry land.
> 6	Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *
> and kneel before the LORD our Maker.
> 7	For he is our God,
> and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *
> Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!
> 8	Harden not your hearts,
> as your forebears did in the wilderness, *
> at Meribah, and on that day at Massah,
> when they tempted me.
> 9	They put me to the test, *
> though they had seen my works.
> 10	Forty years long I detested that generation and said, *
> "This people are wayward in their hearts;
> they do not know my ways."
> 11	So I swore in my wrath, *
> "They shall not enter into my rest."
