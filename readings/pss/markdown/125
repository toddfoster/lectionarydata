_Qui confidunt_

> 1	Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, \*  
> which cannot be moved, but stands fast for ever.  
> 2	The hills stand about Jerusalem; \*  
> so does the LORD stand round about his people,  
> from this time forth for evermore.  
> 3	The scepter of the wicked shall not hold sway over the land allotted to the just, \*  
> so that the just shall not put their hands to evil.  
> 4	Show your goodness, O LORD, to those who are good \*  
> and to those who are true of heart.  
> 5	As for those who turn aside to crooked ways,  
> the LORD will lead them away with the evildoers; \*  
> but peace be upon Israel.
