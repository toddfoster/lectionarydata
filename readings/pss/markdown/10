_Ut quid, Domine?_

> 1	Why do you stand so far off, O LORD, *
> and hide yourself in time of trouble?
> 2	The wicked arrogantly persecute the poor, *
> but they are trapped in the schemes they have devised.
> 3	The wicked boast of their heart's desire; *
> the covetous curse and revile the LORD.
> 4	The wicked are so proud that they care not for God; *
> their only thought is, "God does not matter."
> 5	Their ways are devious at all times;
> your judgments are far above out of their sight; *
> they defy all their enemies.
> 6	They say in their heart, "I shall not be shaken; *
> no harm shall happen to me ever."
> 7	Their mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression; *
> under their tongue are mischief and wrong.
> 8	They lurk in ambush in public squares
> and in secret places they murder the innocent; *
> they spy out the helpless.
> 9	They lie in wait, like a lion in a covert;
> they lie in wait to seize upon the lowly; *
> they seize the lowly and drag them away in their net.
> 10	The innocent are broken and humbled before them; *
> the helpless fall before their power.
> 11	They say in their heart, "God has forgotten; *
> he hides his face; he will never notice."
> 12	Rise up, O LORD;
> lift up your hand, O God; *
> do not forget the afflicted.
> 13	Why should the wicked revile God? *
> why should they say in their heart, "You do not care"?
> 14	Surely, you behold trouble and misery; *
> you see it and take it into your own hand.
> 15	The helpless commit themselves to you, *
> for you are the helper of orphans.
> 16	Break the power of the wicked and evil; *
> search out their wickedness until you find none.
> 17	The LORD is King for ever and ever; *
> the ungodly shall perish from his land.
> 18	The LORD will hear the desire of the humble; *
> you will strengthen their heart and your ears shall hear;
> 19	To give justice to the orphan and oppressed, *
> so that mere mortals may strike terror no more.
