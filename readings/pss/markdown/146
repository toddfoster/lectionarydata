_Lauda, anima mea_

> 1	Hallelujah!
> Praise the LORD, O my soul! *
> I will praise the LORD as long as I live;
> I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
> 2	Put not your trust in rulers, nor in any child of earth, *
> for there is no help in them.
> 3	When they breathe their last, they return to earth, *
> and in that day their thoughts perish.
> 4	Happy are they who have the God of Jacob for their help! *
> whose hope is in the LORD their God;
> 5	Who made heaven and earth, the seas, and all that is in them; *
> who keeps his promise for ever;
> 6	Who gives justice to those who are oppressed, *
> and food to those who hunger.
> 7	The LORD sets the prisoners free;
> the LORD opens the eyes of the blind; *
> the LORD lifts up those who are bowed down;
> 8	The LORD loves the righteous;
> the LORD cares for the stranger; *
> he sustains the orphan and widow,
> but frustrates the way of the wicked.
> 9	The LORD shall reign for ever, *
> your God, O Zion, throughout all generations.
> Hallelujah!
