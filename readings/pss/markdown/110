_Dixit Dominus_

> 1	The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, *
> until I make your enemies your footstool."
> 2	The LORD will send the scepter of your power out of Zion, *
> saying, "Rule over your enemies round about you.
> 3	Princely state has been yours from the day of your birth; *
> in the beauty of holiness have I begotten you,
> like dew from the womb of the morning."
> 4	The LORD has sworn and he will not recant: *
> "You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."
> 5	The Lord who is at your right hand
> will smite kings in the day of his wrath; *
> he will rule over the nations.
> 6	He will heap high the corpses; *
> he will smash heads over the wide earth.
> 7	He will drink from the brook beside the road; *
> therefore he will lift high his head.
