_Deus deorum_

> 1	The LORD, the God of gods, has spoken; \*  
> he has called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.  
> 2	Out of Zion, perfect in its beauty, \*  
> God reveals himself in glory.  
> 3	Our God will come and will not keep silence; \*  
> before him there is a consuming flame,  
> and round about him a raging storm.  
> 4	He calls the heavens and the earth from above \*  
> to witness the judgment of his people.  
> 5	"Gather before me my loyal followers, \*  
> those who have made a covenant with me  
> and sealed it with sacrifice."  
> 6	Let the heavens declare the rightness of his cause; \*  
> for God himself is judge.  
> 7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak:  
> "O Israel, I will bear witness against you; \*  
> for I am God, your God.  
> 8	I do not accuse you because of your sacrifices; \*  
> your offerings are always before me.  
> 9	I will take no bull-calf from your stalls, \*  
> nor he-goats out of your pens;  
> 10	For all the beasts of the forest are mine, \*  
> the herds in their thousands upon the hills.  
> 11	I know every bird in the sky, \*  
> and the creatures of the fields are in my sight.  
> 12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you, \*  
> for the whole world is mine and all that is in it.  
> 13	Do you think I eat the flesh of bulls, \*  
> or drink the blood of goats?  
> 14	Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving \*  
> and make good your vows to the Most High.  
> 15	Call upon me in the day of trouble; \*  
> I will deliver you, and you shall honor me."  
> 16	But to the wicked God says: \*  
> Why do you recite my statutes,  
> and take my covenant upon your lips;  
> 17	Since you refuse discipline, \*  
> and toss my words behind your back?  
> 18	When you see a thief, you make him your friend, \*  
> and you cast in your lot with adulterers.  
> 19	You have loosed your lips for evil, \*  
> and harnessed your tongue to a lie.  
> 20	You are always speaking evil of your brother \*  
> and slandering your own mother's son.  
> 21	These things you have done, and I kept still, \*  
> and you thought that I am like you."  
> 22	"I have made my accusation; \*  
> I have put my case in order before your eyes.  
> 23	Consider this well, you who forget God, \*  
> lest I rend you and there be none to deliver you.  
> 24	Whoever offers me the sacrifice of thanksgiving honors me; \*  
> but to those who keep in my way will I show the salvation of God."
