_Domine, ne in furore_

> 1	LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger; \*  
> do not punish me in your wrath.  
> 2	Have pity on me, LORD, for I am weak; \*  
> heal me, LORD, for my bones are racked.  
> 3	My spirit shakes with terror; \*  
> how long, O LORD, how long?  
> 4	Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; \*  
> save me for your mercy's sake.  
> 5	For in death no one remembers you; \*  
> and who will give you thanks in the grave?  
> 6	I grow weary because of my groaning; \*  
> every night I drench my bed  
> and flood my couch with tears.  
> 7	My eyes are wasted with grief \*  
> and worn away because of all my enemies.  
> 8	Depart from me, all evildoers, \*  
> for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.  
> 9	The LORD has heard my supplication; \*  
> the LORD accepts my prayer.  
> 10	All my enemies shall be confounded and quake with fear; \*  
> they shall turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
