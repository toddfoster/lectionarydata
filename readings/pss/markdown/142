_Voce mea ad Dominum_

> 1	I cry to the LORD with my voice; *
> to the LORD I make loud supplication.
> 2	I pour out my complaint before him *
> and tell him all my trouble.
> 3	When my spirit languishes within me, you know my path; *
> in the way wherein I walk they have hidden a trap for me.
> 4	I look to my right hand and find no one who knows me; *
> I have no place to flee to, and no one cares for me.
> 5	I cry out to you, O LORD; *
> I say, "You are my refuge,
> my portion in the land of the living."
> 6	Listen to my cry for help, for I have been brought very low; *
> save me from those who pursue me,
> for they are too strong for me.
> 7	Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your Name; *
> when you have dealt bountifully with me,
> the righteous will gather around me.
