_Confitebor tibi_

> 1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; \*  
> I will tell of all your marvelous works.  
> 2	I will be glad and rejoice in you; \*  
> I will sing to your Name, O Most High.  
> 3	When my enemies are driven back, \*  
> they will stumble and perish at your presence.  
> 4	For you have maintained my right and my cause; \*  
> you sit upon your throne judging right.  
> 5	You have rebuked the ungodly and destroyed the wicked; \*  
> you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.  
> 6	As for the enemy, they are finished, in perpetual ruin, \*  
> their cities plowed under, the memory of them perished;  
> 7	But the LORD is enthroned for ever; \*  
> he has set up his throne for judgment.  
> 8	It is he who rules the world with righteousness; \*  
> he judges the peoples with equity.  
> 9	The LORD will be a refuge for the oppressed, \*  
> a refuge in time of trouble.  
> 10	Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, \*  
> for you never forsake those who seek you, O LORD.  
> 11	Sing praise to the LORD who dwells in Zion; \*  
> proclaim to the peoples the things he has done.  
> 12	The Avenger of blood will remember them; \*  
> he will not forget the cry of the afflicted.  
> 13	Have pity on me, O LORD; \*  
> see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,  
> O you who lift me up from the gate of death;  
> 14	So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in your salvation \*  
> in the gates of the city of Zion.  
> 15	The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, \*  
> and in the snare they set is their own foot caught.  
> 16	The LORD is known by his acts of justice; \*  
> the wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands.  
> 17	The wicked shall be given over to the grave, \*  
> and also all the people that forget God.  
> 18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten, \*  
> and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.  
> 19	Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; \*  
> let them be judged before you.  
> 20	Put fear upon them, O LORD; \*  
> let the ungodly know they are but mortal.
