_Non nobis, Domine_

> 1	Not to us, O LORD, not to us,  
> but to your Name give glory; \*  
> because of your love and because of your faithfulness.  
> 2	Why should the heathen say, \*  
> "Where then is their God?"  
> 3	Our God is in heaven; \*  
> whatever he wills to do he does.  
> 4	Their idols are silver and gold, \*  
> the work of human hands.  
> 5	They have mouths, but they cannot speak; \*  
> eyes have they, but they cannot see;  
> 6	They have ears but they cannot hear; \*  
> noses, but they cannot smell;  
> 7	They have hands, but they cannot feel;  
> feet, but they cannot walk; \*  
> they make no sound with their throat.  
> 8	Those who make them are like them, \*  
> and so are all who put their trust in them.  
> 9	O Israel, trust in the LORD; \*  
> he is their help and their shield.  
> 10	O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; \*  
> he is their help and their shield.  
> 11	You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; \*  
> he is their help and their shield.  
> 12	The LORD has been mindful of us, and he will bless us; \*  
> he will bless the house of Israel;  
> he will bless the house of Aaron;  
> 13	He will bless those who fear the LORD, \*  
> both small and great together.  
> 14	May the LORD increase you more and more, \*  
> you and your children after you.  
> 15	May you be blessed by the LORD, \*  
> the maker of heaven and earth.  
> 16	The heaven of heavens is the LORD'S, \*  
> but he entrusted the earth to its peoples.  
> 17	The dead do not praise the LORD, \*  
> nor all those who go down into silence;  
> 18	But we will bless the LORD, \*  
> from this time forth for evermore.  
> Hallelujah!
