_Inclina, Domine_

> 1	Bow down your ear, O LORD, and answer me, *
> for I am poor and in misery.
> 2	Keep watch over my life, for I am faithful; *
> save your servant who puts his trust in you.
> 3	Be merciful to me, O LORD, for you are my God; *
> I call upon you all the day long.
> 4	Gladden the soul of your servant, *
> for to you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.
> 5	For you, O LORD, are good and forgiving, *
> and great is your love toward all who call upon you.
> 6	Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer, *
> and attend to the voice of my supplications.
> 7	In the time of my trouble I will call upon you, *
> for you will answer me.
> 8	Among the gods there is none like you, O LORD, *
> nor anything like your works.
> 9	All the nations you have made will come and worship you, O LORD, *
> and glorify your Name.
> 10	For you are great;
> you do wondrous things; *
> and you alone are God.
> 11	Teach me your way, O LORD,
> and I will walk in your truth; *
> knit my heart to you that I may fear your Name.
> 12	I will thank you, O LORD my God, with all my heart, *
> and glorify your Name for evermore.
> 13	For great is your love toward me; *
> you have delivered me from the nethermost Pit.
> 14	The arrogant rise up against me, O God,
> and a band of violent men seeks my life; *
> they have not set you before their eyes.
> 15	But you, O LORD, are gracious and full of compassion, *
> slow to anger, and full of kindness and truth.
> 16	Turn to me and have mercy upon me; *
> give your strength to your servant;
> and save the child of your handmaid.
> 17	Show me a sign of your favor,
> so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; *
> because you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
