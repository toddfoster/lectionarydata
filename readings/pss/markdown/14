_Dixit insipiens_

> 1	The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." \*  
> All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;  
> there is none who does any good.  
> 2	The LORD looks down from heaven upon us all, \*  
> to see if there is any who is wise,  
> if there is one who seeks after God.  
> 3	Every one has proved faithless;  
> all alike have turned bad; \*  
> there is none who does good; no, not one.  
> 4	Have they no knowledge, all those evildoers \*  
> who eat up my people like bread  
> and do not call upon the LORD?  
> 5	See how they tremble with fear, \*  
> because God is in the company of the righteous.  
> 6	Their aim is to confound the plans of the afflicted, \*  
> but the LORD is their refuge.  
> 7	Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! \*  
> when the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,  
> Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.
