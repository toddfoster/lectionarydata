_Dilexi, quoniam_

> 1	I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *
> because he has inclined his ear to me whenever
> I called upon him.
> 2	The cords of death entangled me;
> the grip of the grave took hold of me; *
> I came to grief and sorrow.
> 3	Then I called upon the Name of the LORD: *
> "O LORD, I pray you, save my life."
> 4	Gracious is the LORD and righteous; *
> our God is full of compassion.
> 5	The LORD watches over the innocent; *
> I was brought very low, and he helped me.
> 6	Turn again to your rest, O my soul. *
> for the LORD has treated you well.
> 7	For you have rescued my life from death, *
> my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
> 8	I will walk in the presence of the LORD *
> in the land of the living.
> 9	I believed, even when I said,
> "I have been brought very low." *
> In my distress I said, "No one can be trusted."
> 10	How shall I repay the LORD *
> for all the good things he has done for me?
> 11	I will lift up the cup of salvation *
> and call upon the Name of the LORD.
> 12	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *
> in the presence of all his people.
> 13	Precious in the sight of the LORD *
> is the death of his servants.
> 14	O LORD, I am your servant; *
> I am your servant and the child of your handmaid;
> you have freed me from my bonds.
> 15	I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *
> and call upon the Name of the LORD.
> 16	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *
> in the presence of all his people,
> 17	In the courts of the LORD'S house, *
> in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.
> Hallelujah!
