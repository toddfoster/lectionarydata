_Memento, Domine_

> 1	LORD, remember David, \*  
> and all the hardships he endured;  
> 2	How he swore an oath to the LORD \*  
> and vowed a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:  
> 3	"I will not come under the roof of my house, \*  
> nor climb up into my bed;  
> 4	I will not allow my eyes to sleep, \*  
> nor let my eyelids slumber;  
> 5	Until I find a place for the LORD, \*  
> a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."  
> 6	"The ark! We heard it was in Ephratah; \*  
> we found it in the fields of Jearim.  
> 7	Let us go to God's dwelling place; \*  
> let us fall upon our knees before his footstool."  
> 8	Arise, O LORD, into your resting-place, \*  
> you and the ark of your strength.  
> 9	Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; \*  
> let your faithful people sing with joy.  
> 10	For your servant David's sake, \*  
> do not turn away the face of your Anointed.  
> 11	The LORD has sworn an oath to David; \*  
> in truth, he will not break it:  
> 12	"A son, the fruit of your body \*  
> will I set upon your throne.  
> 13	If your children keep my covenant  
> and my testimonies that I shall teach them, \*  
> their children will sit upon your throne for evermore."  
> 14	For the LORD has chosen Zion; \*  
> he has desired her for his habitation:  
> 15	"This shall be my resting-place for ever; \*  
> here will I dwell, for I delight in her.  
> 16	I will surely bless her provisions, \*  
> and satisfy her poor with bread.  
> 17	I will clothe her priests with salvation, \*  
> and her faithful people will rejoice and sing.  
> 18	There will I make the horn of David flourish; \*  
> I have prepared a lamp for my Anointed.  
> 19	As for his enemies, I will clothe them with shame; \*  
> but as for him, his crown will shine."
