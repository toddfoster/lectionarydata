_Deus ultionum_

> 1	O LORD God of vengeance, *
> O God of vengeance, show yourself.
> 2	Rise up, O Judge of the world; *
> give the arrogant their just deserts.
> 3	How long shall the wicked, O LORD, *
> how long shall the wicked triumph?
> 4	They bluster in their insolence; *
> all evildoers are full of boasting.
> 5	They crush your people, O LORD, *
> and afflict your chosen nation.
> 6	They murder the widow and the stranger *
> and put the orphans to death.
> 7	Yet they say, "The LORD does not see, *
> the God of Jacob takes no notice."
> 8	Consider well, you dullards among the people; *
> when will you fools understand?
> 9	He that planted the ear, does he not hear? *
> he that formed the eye, does he not see?
> 10	He who admonishes the nations, will he not punish? *
> he who teaches all the world, has he no knowledge?
> 11	The LORD knows our human thoughts; *
> how like a puff of wind they are.
> 12	Happy are they whom you instruct, O Lord! *
> whom you teach out of your law;
> 13	To give them rest in evil days, *
> until a pit is dug for the wicked.
> 14	For the LORD will not abandon his people, *
> nor will he forsake his own.
> 15	For judgment will again be just, *
> and all the true of heart will follow it.
> 16	Who rose up for me against the wicked? *
> who took my part against the evildoers?
> 17	If the LORD had not come to my help, *
> I should soon have dwelt in the land of silence.
> 18	As often as I said, "My foot has slipped," *
> your love, O LORD, upheld me.
> 19	When many cares fill my mind, *
> your consolations cheer my soul.
> 20	Can a corrupt tribunal have any part with you, *
> one which frames evil into law?
> 21	They conspire against the life of the just *
> and condemn the innocent to death.
> 22	But the LORD has become my stronghold, *
> and my God the rock of my trust.
> 23	He will turn their wickedness back upon them
> and destroy them in their own malice; *
> the LORD our God will destroy them.
