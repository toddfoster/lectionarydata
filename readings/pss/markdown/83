_Deus, quis similis?_

> 1	O God, do not be silent; \*  
> do not keep still nor hold your peace, O God;  
> 2	For your enemies are in tumult, \*  
> and those who hate you have lifted up their heads.  
> 3	They take secret counsel against your people \*  
> and plot against those whom you protect.  
> 4	They have said, "Come, let us wipe them out from among the nations; \*  
> let the name of Israel be remembered no more."  
> 5	They have conspired together; \*  
> they have made an alliance against you:  
> 6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; \*  
> the Moabites and the Hagarenes;  
> 7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; \*  
> the Philistines and those who dwell in Tyre.  
> 8	The Assyrians also have joined them, \*  
> and have come to help the people of Lot.  
> 9	Do to them as you did to Midian, \*  
> to Sisera, and to Jabin at the river of Kishon:  
> 10	They were destroyed at Endor; \*  
> they became like dung upon the ground.  
> 11	Make their leaders like Oreb and Zeëb, \*  
> and all their commanders like Zebah and Zalmunna,  
> 12	Who said, "Let us take for ourselves \*  
> the fields of God as our possession."  
> 13	O my God, make them like whirling dust \*  
> and like chaff before the wind;  
> 14	Like fire that burns down a forest, \*  
> like the flame that sets mountains ablaze.  
> 15	Drive them with your tempest \*  
> and terrify them with your storm;  
> 16	Cover their faces with shame, O LORD, \*  
> that they may seek your Name.  
> 17	Let them be disgraced and terrified for ever; \*  
> let them be put to confusion and perish.  
> 18	Let them know that you, whose Name is YAHWEH, \*  
> you alone are the Most High over all the earth.
