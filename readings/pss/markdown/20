_Exaudiat te Dominus_

> 1	May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble, *
> the Name of the God of Jacob defend you;
> 2	Send you help from his holy place *
> and strengthen you out of Zion;
> 3	Remember all your offerings *
> and accept your burnt sacrifice;
> 4	Grant you your heart's desire *
> and prosper all your plans.
> 5	We will shout for joy at your victory
> and triumph in the Name of our God; *
> may the LORD grant all your requests.
> 6	Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his anointed; *
> he will answer him out of his holy heaven,
> with the victorious strength of his right hand.
> 7	Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, *
> but we will call upon the Name of the LORD our God.
> 8	They collapse and fall down, *
> but we will arise and stand upright.
> 9	O LORD, give victory to the king *
> and answer us when we call.
