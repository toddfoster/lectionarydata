_Confitebimur tibi_

> 1	We give you thanks, O God, we give you thanks, *
> calling upon your Name and declaring all your wonderful deeds.
> 2	"I will appoint a time," says God; *
> "I will judge with equity.
> 3	Though the earth and all its inhabitants are quaking, *
> I will make its pillars fast.
> 4	I will say to the boasters, 'Boast no more,' *
> and to the wicked, 'Do not toss your horns;
> 5	Do not toss your horns so high, *
> nor speak with a proud neck.'"
> 6	For judgment is neither from the east nor from the west, *
> nor yet from the wilderness or the mountains.
> 7	It is God who judges; *
> he puts down one and lifts up another.
> 8	For in the LORD'S hand there is a cup,
> full of spiced and foaming wine, which he pours out, *
> and all the wicked of the earth shall drink and
> drain the dregs.
> 9	But I will rejoice for ever; *
> I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
> 10	He shall break off all the horns of the wicked; *
> but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
