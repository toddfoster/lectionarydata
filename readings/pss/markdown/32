_Beati quorum_

> 1	Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven, *
> and whose sin is put away!
> 2	Happy are they to whom the LORD imputes no guilt, *
> and in whose spirit there is no guile!
> 3	While I held my tongue, my bones withered away, *
> because of my groaning all day long.
> 4	For your hand was heavy upon me day and night; *
> my moisture was dried up as in the heat of summer.
> 5	Then I acknowledged my sin to you, *
> and did not conceal my guilt.
> 6	I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD." *
> Then you forgave me the guilt of my sin.
> 7	Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in time of trouble; *
> when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach them.
> 8	You are my hiding-place;
> you preserve me from trouble; *
> you surround me with shouts of deliverance.
> 9	"I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go; *
> I will guide you with my eye.
> 10	Do not be like horse or mule, which have no understanding; *
> who must be fitted with bit and bridle,
> or else they will not stay near you."
> 11	Great are the tribulations of the wicked; *
> but mercy embraces those who trust in the LORD.
> 12	Be glad, you righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; *
> shout for joy, all who are true of heart.
