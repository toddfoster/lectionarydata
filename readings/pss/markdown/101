_Misericordiam et judicium_

> 1	I will sing of mercy and justice; *
> to you, O LORD, will I sing praises.
> 2	I will strive to follow a blameless course;
> oh, when will you come to me? *
> I will walk with sincerity of heart within my house.
> 3	I will set no worthless thing before my eyes; *
> I hate the doers of evil deeds;
> they shall not remain with me.
> 4	A crooked heart shall be far from me; *
> I will not know evil.
> 5	Those who in secret slander their neighbors I will destroy; *
> those who have a haughty look and a proud heart I cannot abide.
> 6	My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me, *
> and only those who lead a blameless life shall be my servants.
> 7	Those who act deceitfully shall not dwell in my house, *
> and those who tell lies shall not continue in my sight.
> 8	I will soon destroy all the wicked in the land, *
> that I may root out all evildoers from the city of the LORD.
