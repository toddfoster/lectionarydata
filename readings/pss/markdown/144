_Benedictus Dominus_

> 1	Blessed be the LORD my rock! \*  
> who trains my hands to fight and my fingers to battle;  
> 2	My help and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, \*  
> my shield in whom I trust,  
> who subdues the peoples under me.  
> 3	O LORD, what are we that you should care for us? \*  
> mere mortals that you should think of us?  
> 4	We are like a puff of wind; \*  
> our days are like a passing shadow.  
> 5	Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down; \*  
> touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.  
> 6	Hurl the lightning and scatter them; \*  
> shoot out your arrows and rout them.  
> 7	Stretch out your hand from on high; \*  
> rescue me and deliver me from the great waters,  
> from the hand of foreign peoples,  
> 8	Whose mouths speak deceitfully \*  
> and whose right hand is raised in falsehood.  
> 9	O God, I will sing to you a new song; \*  
> I will play to you on a ten-stringed lyre.  
> 10	You give victory to kings \*  
> and have rescued David your servant.  
> 11	Rescue me from the hurtful sword \*  
> and deliver me from the hand of foreign peoples,  
> 12	Whose mouths speak deceitfully \*  
> and whose right hand is raised in falsehood.  
> 13	May our sons be like plants well nurtured from their youth, \*  
> and our daughters like sculptured corners of a palace.  
> 14	May our barns be filled to overflowing with all manner of crops; \*  
> may the flocks in our pastures increase by thousands and tens of thousands;  
> may our cattle be fat and sleek.  
> 15	May there be no breaching of the walls, no going into exile, \*  
> no wailing in the public squares.  
> 16	Happy are the people of whom this is so! \*  
> happy are the people whose God is the LORD!
