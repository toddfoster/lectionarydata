_Paratum cor meum_

> 1	My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; *
> I will sing and make melody.
> 2	Wake up, my spirit;
> awake, lute and harp; *
> I myself will waken the dawn.
> 3	I will confess you among the peoples, O LORD; *
> I will sing praises to you among the nations.
> 4	For your loving-kindness is greater than the heavens, *
> and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
> 5	Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *
> and your glory over all the earth.
> 6	So that those who are dear to you may be delivered, *
> save with your right hand and answer me.
> 7	God spoke from his holy place and said, *
> "I will exult and parcel out Shechem;
> I will divide the valley of Succoth.
> 8	Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine; *
> Ephraim is my helmet and Judah my scepter.
> 9	Moab is my washbasin,
> on Edom I throw down my sandal to claim it, *
> and over Philistia will I shout in triumph."
> 10	Who will lead me into the strong city? *
> who will bring me into Edom?
> 11	Have you not cast us off, O God? *
> you no longer go out, O God, with our armies.
> 12	Grant us your help against the enemy, *
> for vain is the help of man.
> 13	With God we will do valiant deeds, *
> and he shall tread our enemies under foot.
