_Si vere utique_

> 1	Do you indeed decree righteousness, you rulers? \*  
do you judge the peoples with equity?  
> **2	No; you devise evil in your hearts, \*  
and your hands deal out violence in the land.**  
  
> 3	The wicked are perverse from the womb; \*  
liars go astray from their birth.  
> **4	They are as venomous as a serpent, \*  
they are like the deaf adder which stops its ears,**  
  
> 5	Which does not heed the voice of the charmer, \*  
no matter how skillful his charming.  
> **6	O God, break their teeth in their mouths; \*  
pull the fangs of the young lions, O LORD.**  
  
> 7	Let them vanish like water that runs off; \*  
let them wither like trodden grass.  
> **8	Let them be like the snail that melts away, \*  
like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.**  
  
> 9	Before they bear fruit, let them be cut down like a brier; \*  
like thorns and thistles let them be swept away.  
> **10	The righteous will be glad when they see the vengeance; \*  
they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.**  
  
> 11	And they will say,  
"Surely, there is a reward for the righteous; \*  
surely, there is a God who rules in the earth."
