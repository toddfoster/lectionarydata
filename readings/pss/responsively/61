_Exaudi, Deus_

> 1	Hear my cry, O God, *
and listen to my prayer.
> **2	I call upon you from the ends of the earth with heaviness in my heart; *
set me upon the rock that is higher than I.**

> 3	For you have been my refuge, *
a strong tower against the enemy.
> **4	I will dwell in your house for ever; *
I will take refuge under the cover of your wings.**

> 5	For you, O God, have heard my vows; *
you have granted me the heritage of those who fear your Name.
> **6	Add length of days to the king's life; *
let his years extend over many generations.**

> 7	Let him sit enthroned before God for ever; *
bid love and faithfulness watch over him.
> **8	So will I always sing the praise of your Name, *
and day by day I will fulfill my vows.**
