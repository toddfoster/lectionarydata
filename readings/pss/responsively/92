_Bonum est confiteri_

> 1	It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, *
and to sing praises to your Name, O Most High;
> **2	To tell of your loving-kindness early in the morning *
and of your faithfulness in the night season;**

> 3	On the psaltery, and on the lyre, *
and to the melody of the harp.
> **4	For you have made me glad by your acts, O LORD; *
and I shout for joy because of the works of your hands.**

> 5	LORD, how great are your works! *
your thoughts are very deep.
> **6	The dullard does not know,
nor does the fool understand, *
that though the wicked grow like weeds,
and all the workers of iniquity flourish,**

> 7	They flourish only to be destroyed for ever; *
but you, O LORD, are exalted for evermore.
> **8	For lo, your enemies, O LORD,
lo, your enemies shall perish, *
and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.**

> 9	But my horn you have exalted like the horns of wild bulls; *
I am anointed with fresh oil.
> **10	My eyes also gloat over my enemies, *
and my ears rejoice to hear the doom of the wicked who rise up against me.**

> 11	The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, *
and shall spread abroad like a cedar of Lebanon.
> **12	Those who are planted in the house of the LORD *
shall flourish in the courts of our God;**

> 13	They shall still bear fruit in old age; *
they shall be green and succulent;
> **14	That they may show how upright the LORD is, *
my Rock, in whom there is no fault.**
