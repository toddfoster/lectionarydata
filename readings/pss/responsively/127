_Nisi Dominus_

> 1	Unless the LORD builds the house, *
their labor is in vain who build it.
> **2	Unless the LORD watches over the city, *
in vain the watchman keeps his vigil.**

> 3	It is in vain that you rise so early and go to bed so late; *
vain, too, to eat the bread of toil,
for he gives to his beloved sleep.
> **4	Children are a heritage from the LORD, *
and the fruit of the womb is a gift.**

> 5	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior *
are the children of one's youth.
> **6	Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them! *
he shall not be put to shame
when he contends with his enemies in the gate.**
