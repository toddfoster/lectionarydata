_Domine, probasti_

> 1	LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *
you know my sitting down and my rising up;
you discern my thoughts from afar.
> **2	You trace my journeys and my resting-places *
and are acquainted with all my ways.**

> 3	Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.
> **4	You press upon me behind and before *
and lay your hand upon me.**

> 5	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.
> **6	Where can I go then from your Spirit? *
where can I flee from your presence?**

> 7	If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.
> **8	If I take the wings of the morning *
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,**

> 9	Even there your hand will lead me *
and your right hand hold me fast.
> **10	If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, *
and the light around me turn to night,"**

> 11	Darkness is not dark to you;
the night is as bright as the day; *
darkness and light to you are both alike.
> **12	For you yourself created my inmost parts; *
you knit me together in my mother's womb.**

> 13	I will thank you because I am marvelously made; *
your works are wonderful, and I know it well.
> **14	My body was not hidden from you, *
while I was being made in secret
and woven in the depths of the earth.**

> 15	Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;
all of them were written in your book; *
they were fashioned day by day,
when as yet there was none of them.
> **16	How deep I find your thoughts, O God! *
how great is the sum of them!**

> 17	If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the sand; *
to count them all, my life span would need to
be like yours.
> **18	Oh, that you would slay the wicked, O God! *
You that thirst for blood, depart from me.**

> 19	They speak despitefully against you; *
your enemies take your Name in vain.
> **20	Do I not hate those, O LORD, who hate you? *
and do I not loathe those who rise up against you?**

> 21	I hate them with a perfect hatred; *
they have become my own enemies.
> **22	Search me out, O God, and know my heart; *
try me and know my restless thoughts.**

> 23	Look well whether there be any wickedness in me *
and lead me in the way that is everlasting.
