_Ecce, quam bonum!_

> 1	Oh, how good and pleasant it is, *
when brethren live together in unity!
> **2	It is like fine oil upon the head *
that runs down upon the beard,**

> 3	Upon the beard of Aaron, *
and runs down upon the collar of his robe.
> **4	It is like the dew of Hermon *
that falls upon the hills of Zion.**

> 5	For there the LORD has ordained the blessing: *
life for evermore.
