_Miserere mei, Deus_

> 1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your
loving-kindness; *
in your great compassion blot out my offenses.
> **2	Wash me through and through from my wickedness *
and cleanse me from my sin.**

> 3	For I know my transgressions, *
and my sin is ever before me.
> **4	Against you only have I sinned *
and done what is evil in your sight.**

> 5	And so you are justified when you speak *
and upright in your judgment.
> **6	Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, *
a sinner from my mother's womb.**

> 7	For behold, you look for truth deep within me, *
and will make me understand wisdom secretly
> **8	Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; *
wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.**

> 9	Make me hear of joy and gladness, *
that the body you have broken may rejoice.
> **10	Hide your face from my sins *
and blot out all my iniquities.**

> 11	Create in me a clean heart, O God, *
and renew a right spirit within me.
> **12	Cast me not away from your presence *
and take not your holy Spirit from me.**

> 13	Give me the joy of your saving help again *
and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.
> **14	I shall teach your ways to the wicked, *
and sinners shall return to you.**

> 15	Deliver me from death, O God, *
and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness,
O God of my salvation.
> **16	Open my lips, O Lord, *
and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.**

> 17	Had you desired it, I would have offered sacrifice, *
but you take no delight in burnt-offerings.
> **18	The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; *
a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.**

> 19	Be favorable and gracious to Zion, *
and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
> **20	Then you will be pleased with the appointed sacrifices,
with burnt-offerings and oblations; *
then shall they offer young bullocks upon your altar.**
