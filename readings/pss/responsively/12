_Salvum me fac_

> 1	Help me, LORD, for there is no godly one left; *
the faithful have vanished from among us.
> **2	Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *
with a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart.**

> 3	Oh, that the LORD would cut off all smooth tongues, *
and close the lips that utter proud boasts!
> **4	Those who say, "With our tongue will we prevail; *
our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"**

> 5	"Because the needy are oppressed,
and the poor cry out in misery, *
I will rise up," says the LORD,
"and give them the help they long for."
> **6	The words of the LORD are pure words, *
like silver refined from ore
and purified seven times in the fire.**

> 7	O LORD, watch over us *
and save us from this generation for ever.
> **8	The wicked prowl on every side, *
and that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.**
