_Quam dilecta!_

> 1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
> **2	The sparrow has found her a house
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,
my King and my God.**

> 3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *
they will always be praising you.
> **4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims' way.**

> 5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.
> **6	They will climb from height to height, *
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.**

> 7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *
hearken, O God of Jacob.
> **8	Behold our defender, O God; *
and look upon the face of your Anointed.**

> 9	For one day in your courts is better than
a thousand in my own room, *
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.
> **10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *
he will give grace and glory;**

> 11	No good thing will the LORD withhold *
from those who walk with integrity.
> **12	O LORD of hosts, *
happy are they who put their trust in you!**
