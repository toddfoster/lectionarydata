_Afferte Domino_

> 1	Ascribe to the LORD, you gods, *
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
> **2	Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his Name; *
worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.**

> 3	The voice of the LORD is upon the waters;
the God of glory thunders; *
the LORD is upon the mighty waters.
> **4	The voice of the LORD is a powerful voice; *
the voice of the LORD is a voice of splendor.**

> 5	The voice of the LORD breaks the cedar trees; *
the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon;
> **6	He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, *
and Mount Hermon like a young wild ox.**

> 7	The voice of the LORD splits the flames of fire;
the voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; *
the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
> **8	The voice of the LORD makes the oak trees writhe *
and strips the forests bare.**

> 9	And in the temple of the LORD *
all are crying, "Glory!"
> **10	The LORD sits enthroned above the flood; *
the LORD sits enthroned as King for evermore.**

> 11	The LORD shall give strength to his people; *
the LORD shall give his people the blessing of peace.
