_Domine, Deus meus_

> 1	O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; *
save and deliver me from all who pursue me;
> **2	Lest like a lion they tear me in pieces *
and snatch me away with none to deliver me.**

> 3	O LORD my God, if I have done these things: *
if there is any wickedness in my hands,
> **4	If I have repaid my friend with evil, *
or plundered him who without cause is my enemy;**

> 5	Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me, *
trample my life into the ground,
and lay my honor in the dust.
> **6	Stand up, O LORD, in your wrath; *
rise up against the fury of my enemies.**

> 7	Awake, O my God, decree justice; *
let the assembly of the peoples gather round you.
> **8	Be seated on your lofty throne, O Most High; *
O LORD, judge the nations.**

> 9	Give judgment for me according to my
righteousness, O LORD, *
and according to my innocence, O Most High.
> **10	Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,
but establish the righteous; *
for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God.**

> 11	God is my shield and defense; *
he is the savior of the true in heart.
> **12	God is a righteous judge; *
God sits in judgment every day.**

> 13	If they will not repent, God will whet his sword; *
he will bend his bow and make it ready.
> **14	He has prepared his weapons of death; *
he makes his arrows shafts of fire.**

> 15	Look at those who are in labor with wickedness, *
who conceive evil, and give birth to a lie.
> **16	They dig a pit and make it deep *
and fall into the hole that they have made.**

> 17	Their malice turns back upon their own head; *
their violence falls on their own scalp.
> **18	I will bear witness that the LORD is righteous; *
I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.**
