_Te decet hymnus_

> 1	You are to be praised, O God, in Zion; *
to you shall vows be performed in Jerusalem.
> **2	To you that hear prayer shall all flesh come, *
because of their transgressions.**

> 3	Our sins are stronger than we are, *
but you will blot them out.
> **4	Happy are they whom you choose
and draw to your courts to dwell there! *
they will be satisfied by the beauty of your house,
by the holiness of your temple.**

> 5	Awesome things will you show us in your righteousness,
O God of our salvation, *
O Hope of all the ends of the earth
and of the seas that are far away.
> **6	You make fast the mountains by your power; *
they are girded about with might.**

> 7	You still the roaring of the seas, *
the roaring of their waves,
and the clamor of the peoples.
> **8	Those who dwell at the ends of the earth will tremble at your
marvelous signs; *
you make the dawn and the dusk to sing for joy.**

> 9	You visit the earth and water it abundantly;
you make it very plenteous; *
the river of God is full of water.
> **10	You prepare the grain, *
for so you provide for the earth.**

> 11	You drench the furrows and smooth out the ridges; *
with heavy rain you soften the ground and bless its increase.
> **12	You crown the year with your goodness, *
and your paths overflow with plenty.**

> 13	May the fields of the wilderness be rich for grazing, *
and the hills be clothed with joy.
> **14	May the meadows cover themselves with flocks,
and the valleys cloak themselves with grain; *
let them shout for joy and sing.**
