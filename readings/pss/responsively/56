_Miserere mei, Deus_

> 1	Have mercy on me, O God,
for my enemies are hounding me; *
all day long they assault and oppress me.
> **2	They hound me all the day long; *
truly there are many who fight against me, O Most High.**

> 3	Whenever I am afraid, *
I will put my trust in you.
> **4	In God, whose word I praise,
in God I trust and will not be afraid, *
for what can flesh do to me?**

> 5	All day long they damage my cause; *
their only thought is to do me evil.
> **6	They band together; they lie in wait; *
they spy upon my footsteps;
because they seek my life.**

> 7	Shall they escape despite their wickedness? *
O God, in your anger, cast down the peoples.
> **8	You have noted my lamentation;
put my tears into your bottle; *
are they not recorded in your book?**

> 9	Whenever I call upon you, my enemies will be put to flight; *
this I know, for God is on my side.
> **10	In God the LORD, whose word I praise,
in God I trust and will not be afraid, *
for what can mortals do to me?**

> 11	I am bound by the vow I made to you, O God; *
I will present to you thank-offerings;
> **12	For you have rescued my soul from death and my feet
from stumbling, *
that I may walk before God in the light of the living.**
