_In convertendo_

> 1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *
then were we like those who dream.
> **2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *
and our tongue with shouts of joy.**

> 3	Then they said among the nations, *
"The LORD has done great things for them."
> **4	The LORD has done great things for us, *
and we are glad indeed.**

> 5	Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *
like the watercourses of the Negev.
> **6	Those who sowed with tears *
will reap with songs of joy.**

> 7	Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *
will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.
