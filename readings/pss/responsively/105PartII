_Part II_
_Et intravit Israel_

> 23	Israel came into Egypt, *
and Jacob became a sojourner in the land of Ham.
> **24	The LORD made his people exceedingly fruitful; *
he made them stronger than their enemies;**

> 25	Whose heart he turned, so that they hated his people, *
and dealt unjustly with his servants.
> **26	He sent Moses his servant, *
and Aaron whom he had chosen.**

> 27	They worked his signs among them, *
and portents in the land of Ham.
> **28	He sent darkness, and it grew dark; *
but the Egyptians rebelled against his words.**

> 29	He turned their waters into blood *
and caused their fish to die.
> **30	Their land was overrun by frogs, *
in the very chambers of their kings.**

> 31	He spoke, and there came swarms of insects *
and gnats within all their borders.
> **32	He gave them hailstones instead of rain, *
and flames of fire throughout their land.**

> 33	He blasted their vines and their fig trees *
and shattered every tree in their country.
> **34	He spoke, and the locust came, *
and young locusts without number,**

> 35	Which ate up all the green plants in their land *
and devoured the fruit of their soil.
> **36	He struck down the firstborn of their land, *
the firstfruits of all their strength.**

> 37	He led out his people with silver and gold; *
in all their tribes there was not one that stumbled.
> **38	Egypt was glad of their going, *
because they were afraid of them.**

> 39	He spread out a cloud for a covering *
and a fire to give light in the night season.
> **40	They asked, and quails appeared, *
and he satisfied them with bread from heaven.**

> 41	He opened the rock, and water flowed, *
so the river ran in the dry places.
> **42	For God remembered his holy word *
and Abraham his servant.**

> 43	So he led forth his people with gladness, *
his chosen with shouts of joy.
> **44	He gave his people the lands of the nations, *
and they took the fruit of others' toil,**

> 45	That they might keep his statutes *
and observe his laws.
Hallelujah!
