_De profundis_

> 1	Out of the depths have I called to you, O LORD;
LORD, hear my voice; *
let your ears consider well the voice of my supplication.
> **2	If you, LORD, were to note what is done amiss, *
O LORD, who could stand?**

> 3	For there is forgiveness with you; *
therefore you shall be feared.
> **4	I wait for the LORD; my soul waits for him; *
in his word is my hope.**

> 5	My soul waits for the LORD,
more than watchmen for the morning, *
more than watchmen for the morning.
> **6	O Israel, wait for the LORD, *
for with the LORD there is mercy;**

> 7	With him there is plenteous redemption, *
and he shall redeem Israel from all their sins.
