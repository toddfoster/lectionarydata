_Domine, quis habitabit?_

> 1	LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? \*  
who may abide upon your holy hill?  
> **2	Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, \*  
who speaks the truth from his heart.**  
  
> 3	There is no guile upon his tongue;  
he does no evil to his friend; \*  
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.  
> **4	In his sight the wicked is rejected, \*  
but he honors those who fear the LORD.**  
  
> 5	He has sworn to do no wrong \*  
and does not take back his word.  
> **6	He does not give his money in hope of gain, \*  
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.**  
  
> 7	Whoever does these things \*  
shall never be overthrown.
