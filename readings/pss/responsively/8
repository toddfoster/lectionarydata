_Domine, Dominus noster_

> 1	O LORD our Governor, \*  
how exalted is your Name in all the world!  
> **2	Out of the mouths of infants and children \*  
your majesty is praised above the heavens.**  
  
> 3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, \*  
to quell the enemy and the avenger.  
> **4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, \*  
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,**  
  
> 5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? \*  
the son of man that you should seek him out?  
> **6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; \*  
you adorn him with glory and honor;**  
  
> 7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; \*  
you put all things under his feet:  
> **8	All sheep and oxen, \*  
even the wild beasts of the field,**  
  
> 9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, \*  
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.  
> **10	O LORD our Governor, \*  
how exalted is your Name in all the world!**
