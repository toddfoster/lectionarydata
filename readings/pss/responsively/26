_Judica me, Domine_

> 1	Give judgment for me, O LORD,  
for I have lived with integrity; \*  
I have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered.  
> **2	Test me, O LORD, and try me; \*  
examine my heart and my mind.**  
  
> 3	For your love is before my eyes; \*  
I have walked faithfully with you.  
> **4	I have not sat with the worthless, \*  
nor do I consort with the deceitful.**  
  
> 5	I have hated the company of evildoers; \*  
I will not sit down with the wicked.  
> **6	I will wash my hands in innocence, O LORD, \*  
that I may go in procession round your altar,**  
  
> 7	Singing aloud a song of thanksgiving \*  
and recounting all your wonderful deeds.  
> **8	LORD, I love the house in which you dwell \*  
and the place where your glory abides.**  
  
> 9	Do not sweep me away with sinners, \*  
nor my life with those who thirst for blood,  
> **10	Whose hands are full of evil plots, \*  
and their right hand full of bribes.**  
  
> 11	As for me, I will live with integrity; \*  
redeem me, O LORD, and have pity on me.  
> **12	My foot stands on level ground; \*  
in the full assembly I will bless the LORD.**
