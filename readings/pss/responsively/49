_Audite haec, omnes_

> 1	Hear this, all you peoples;  
hearken, all you who dwell in the world, \*  
you of high degree and low, rich and poor together.  
> **2	My mouth shall speak of wisdom, \*  
and my heart shall meditate on understanding.**  
  
> 3	I will incline my ear to a proverb \*  
and set forth my riddle upon the harp.  
> **4	Why should I be afraid in evil days, \*  
when the wickedness of those at my heels surrounds me,**  
  
> 5	The wickedness of those who put their trust in their goods, \*  
and boast of their great riches?  
> **6	We can never ransom ourselves, \*  
or deliver to God the price of our life;**  
  
> 7	For the ransom of our life is so great, \*  
that we should never have enough to pay it,  
> **8	In order to live for ever and ever, \*  
and never see the grave.**  
  
> 9	For we see that the wise die also;  
like the dull and stupid they perish \*  
and leave their wealth to those who come after them.  
> **10	Their graves shall be their homes for ever,  
their dwelling places from generation to generation, \*  
though they call the lands after their own names.**  
  
> 11	Even though honored, they cannot live for ever; \*  
they are like the beasts that perish.  
> **12	Such is the way of those who foolishly trust in themselves, \*  
and the end of those who delight in their own words.**  
  
> 13	Like a flock of sheep they are destined to die;  
Death is their shepherd; \*  
they go down straightway to the grave.  
> **14	Their form shall waste away, \*  
and the land of the dead shall be their home.**  
  
> 15	But God will ransom my life; \*  
he will snatch me from the grasp of death.  
> **16	Do not be envious when some become rich, \*  
or when the grandeur of their house increases;**  
  
> 17	For they will carry nothing away at their death, \*  
nor will their grandeur follow them.  
> **18	Though they thought highly of themselves while they lived, \*  
and were praised for their success,**  
  
> 19	They shall join the company of their forebears, \*  
who will never see the light again.  
> **20	Those who are honored, but have no understanding, \*  
are like the beasts that perish.**
