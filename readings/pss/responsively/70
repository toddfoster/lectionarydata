_Deus, in adjutorium_

> 1	Be pleased, O God, to deliver me; *
O LORD, make haste to help me.
> **2	Let those who seek my life be ashamed
and altogether dismayed; *
let those who take pleasure in my misfortune
draw back and be disgraced.**

> 3	Let those who say to me "Aha!" and gloat over me turn back, *
because they are ashamed.
> **4	Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; *
let those who love your salvation say for ever,
"Great is the LORD!"**

> 5	But as for me, I am poor and needy; *
come to me speedily, O God.
> **6	You are my helper and my deliverer; *
O LORD, do not tarry.**
