_Exaudi, Domine_

> 1	Hear my plea of innocence, O LORD;
give heed to my cry; *
listen to my prayer, which does not come from lying lips.
> **2	Let my vindication come forth from your presence; *
let your eyes be fixed on justice.**

> 3	Weigh my heart, summon me by night, *
melt me down; you will find no impurity in me.
> **4	I give no offense with my mouth as others do; *
I have heeded the words of your lips.**

> 5	My footsteps hold fast to the ways of your law; *
in your paths my feet shall not stumble.
> **6	I call upon you, O God, for you will answer me; *
incline your ear to me and hear my words.**

> 7	Show me your marvelous loving-kindness, *
O Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand
from those who rise up against them.
> **8	Keep me as the apple of your eye; *
hide me under the shadow of your wings,**

> 9	From the wicked who assault me, *
from my deadly enemies who surround me.
> **10	They have closed their heart to pity, *
and their mouth speaks proud things.**

> 11	They press me hard,
now they surround me, *
watching how they may cast me to the ground,
> **12	Like a lion, greedy for its prey, *
and like a young lion lurking in secret places.**

> 13	Arise, O LORD; confront them and bring them down; *
deliver me from the wicked by your sword.
> **14	Deliver me, O LORD, by your hand *
from those whose portion in life is this world;**

> 15	Whose bellies you fill with your treasure, *
who are well supplied with children
and leave their wealth to their little ones.
> **16	But at my vindication I shall see your face; *
when I awake, I shall be satisfied, beholding your likeness.**
