_Dominus regnavit_

> 1	The LORD is King;
let the earth rejoice; *
let the multitude of the isles be glad.
> **2	Clouds and darkness are round about him, *
righteousness and justice are the foundations of his throne.**

> 3	A fire goes before him *
and burns up his enemies on every side.
> **4	His lightnings light up the world; *
the earth sees it and is afraid.**

> 5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, *
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
> **6	The heavens declare his righteousness, *
and all the peoples see his glory.**

> 7	Confounded be all who worship carved images
and delight in false gods! *
Bow down before him, all you gods.
> **8	Zion hears and is glad, and the cities of Judah rejoice, *
because of your judgments, O LORD.**

> 9	For you are the LORD,
most high over all the earth; *
you are exalted far above all gods.
> **10	The LORD loves those who hate evil; *
he preserves the lives of his saints
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.**

> 11	Light has sprung up for the righteous, *
and joyful gladness for those who are truehearted.
> **12	Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, *
and give thanks to his holy Name.**
