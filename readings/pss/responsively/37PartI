> 1	Do not fret yourself because of evildoers; *
do not be jealous of those who do wrong.
> **2	For they shall soon wither like the grass, *
and like the green grass fade away.**

> 3	Put your trust in the LORD and do good; *
dwell in the land and feed on its riches.
> **4	Take delight in the LORD, *
and he shall give you your heart's desire.**

> 5	Commit your way to the LORD and put your trust in him, *
and he will bring it to pass.
> **6	He will make your righteousness as clear as the light *
and your just dealing as the noonday.**

> 7	Be still before the LORD *
and wait patiently for him.
> **8	Do not fret yourself over the one who prospers, *
the one who succeeds in evil schemes.**

> 9	Refrain from anger, leave rage alone; *
do not fret yourself; it leads only to evil.
> **10	For evildoers shall be cut off, *
but those who wait upon the LORD shall possess the land.**

> 11	In a little while the wicked shall be no more; *
you shall search out their place, but they will not be there.
> **12	But the lowly shall possess the land; *
they will delight in abundance of peace.**

> 13	The wicked plot against the righteous *
and gnash at them with their teeth.
> **14	The Lord laughs at the wicked, *
because he sees that their day will come.**

> 15	The wicked draw their sword and bend their bow
to strike down the poor and needy, *
to slaughter those who are upright in their ways.
> **16	Their sword shall go through their own heart, *
and their bow shall be broken.**

> 17	The little that the righteous has *
is better than great riches of the wicked.
> **18	For the power of the wicked shall be broken, *
but the LORD upholds the righteous.**
