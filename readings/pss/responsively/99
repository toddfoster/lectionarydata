_Dominus regnavit_

> 1	The LORD is King;  
let the people tremble; \*  
he is enthroned upon the cherubim;  
let the earth shake.  
> **2	The LORD is great in Zion; \*  
he is high above all peoples.**  
  
> 3	Let them confess his Name, which is great and awesome; \*  
he is the Holy One.  
> **4	"O mighty King, lover of justice,  
you have established equity; \*  
you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob."**  
  
> 5	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God  
and fall down before his footstool; \*  
he is the Holy One.  
> **6	Moses and Aaron among his priests,  
and Samuel among those who call upon his Name, \*  
they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.**  
  
> 7	He spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud; \*  
they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.  
> **8	"O LORD our God, you answered them indeed; \*  
you were a God who forgave them,  
yet punished them for their evil deeds."**  
  
> 9	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God  
and worship him upon his holy hill; \*  
for the LORD our God is the Holy One.
