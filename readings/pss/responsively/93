_Dominus regnavit_

> 1	The LORD is King;  
he has put on splendid apparel; \*  
the LORD has put on his apparel  
and girded himself with strength.  
> **2	He has made the whole world so sure \*  
that it cannot be moved;**  
  
> 3	Ever since the world began, your throne has been established; \*  
you are from everlasting.  
> **4	The waters have lifted up, O LORD,  
the waters have lifted up their voice; \*  
the waters have lifted up their pounding waves.**  
  
> 5	Mightier than the sound of many waters,  
mightier than the breakers of the sea, \*  
mightier is the LORD who dwells on high.  
> **6	Your testimonies are very sure, \*  
and holiness adorns your house, O LORD,  
for ever and for evermore.**
