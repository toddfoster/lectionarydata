_Judica, Domine_

> 1	Fight those who fight me, O LORD; *
attack those who are attacking me.
> **2	Take up shield and armor *
and rise up to help me.**

> 3	Draw the sword and bar the way against those
who pursue me; *
say to my soul, "I am your salvation."
> **4	Let those who seek after my life be shamed and humbled; *
let those who plot my ruin fall back and be dismayed.**

> 5	Let them be like chaff before the wind, *
and let the angel of the LORD drive them away.
> **6	Let their way be dark and slippery, *
and let the angel of the LORD pursue them.**

> 7	For they have secretly spread a net for me without a cause; *
without a cause they have dug a pit to take me alive.
> **8	Let ruin come upon them unawares; *
let them be caught in the net they hid;
let them fall into the pit they dug.**

> 9	Then I will be joyful in the LORD; *
I will glory in his victory.
> **10	My very bones will say, "LORD, who is like you? *
You deliver the poor from those who are too strong for them,
the poor and needy from those who rob them."**

> 11	Malicious witnesses rise up against me; *
they charge me with matters I know nothing about.
> **12	They pay me evil in exchange for good; *
my soul is full of despair.**

> 13	But when they were sick I dressed in sack-cloth *
and humbled myself by fasting.
> **14	I prayed with my whole heart,
as one would for a friend or a brother; *
I behaved like one who mourns for his mother,
bowed down and grieving.**

> 15	But when I stumbled, they were glad and gathered together;
they gathered against me; *
strangers whom I did not know tore me to pieces and
would not stop.
> **16	They put me to the test and mocked me; *
they gnashed at me with their teeth.**

> 17	O Lord, how long will you look on? *
rescue me from the roaring beasts,
and my life from the young lions.
> **18	I will give you thanks in the great congregation; *
I will praise you in the mighty throng.**

> 19	Do not let my treacherous foes rejoice over me, *
nor let those who hate me without a cause
wink at each other.
> **20	For they do not plan for peace, *
but invent deceitful schemes against the
quiet in the land.**

> 21	They opened their mouths at me and said, *
"Aha! we saw it with our own eyes."
> **22	You saw it, O LORD; do not be silent; *
O Lord, be not far from me.**

> 23	Awake, arise, to my cause! *
to my defense, my God and my Lord!
> **24	Give me justice, O LORD my God,
according to your righteousness; *
do not let them triumph over me.**

> 25	Do not let them say in their hearts,
"Aha! just what we want!" *
Do not let them say, "We have swallowed him up."
> **26	Let all who rejoice at my ruin be ashamed and disgraced; *
let those who boast against me be clothed with
dismay and shame.**

> 27	Let those who favor my cause sing out with joy and be glad; *
let them say always, "Great is the LORD,
who desires the prosperity of his servant."
> **28	And my tongue shall be talking of your righteousness *
and of your praise all the day long.**
