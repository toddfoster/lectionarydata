_Ad te, Domine, levavi_

> 1	To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;  
my God, I put my trust in you; \*  
let me not be humiliated,  
nor let my enemies triumph over me.  
> **2	Let none who look to you be put to shame; \*  
let the treacherous be disappointed in their schemes.**  
  
> 3	Show me your ways, O LORD, \*  
and teach me your paths.  
> **4	Lead me in your truth and teach me, \*  
for you are the God of my salvation;  
in you have I trusted all the day long.**  
  
> 5	Remember, O LORD, your compassion and love, \*  
for they are from everlasting.  
> **6	Remember not the sins of my youth and my transgressions; \*  
remember me according to your love  
and for the sake of your goodness, O LORD.**  
  
> 7	Gracious and upright is the LORD; \*  
therefore he teaches sinners in his way.  
> **8	He guides the humble in doing right \*  
and teaches his way to the lowly.**  
  
> 9	All the paths of the LORD are love and faithfulness \*  
to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.  
> **10	For your Name's sake, O LORD, \*  
forgive my sin, for it is great.**  
  
> 11	Who are they who fear the LORD? \*  
he will teach them the way that they should choose.  
> **12	They shall dwell in prosperity, \*  
and their offspring shall inherit the land.**  
  
> 13	The LORD is a friend to those who fear him \*  
and will show them his covenant.  
> **14	My eyes are ever looking to the LORD, \*  
for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.**  
  
> 15	Turn to me and have pity on me, \*  
for I am left alone and in misery.  
> **16	The sorrows of my heart have increased; \*  
bring me out of my troubles.**  
  
> 17	Look upon my adversity and misery \*  
and forgive me all my sin.  
> **18	Look upon my enemies, for they are many, \*  
and they bear a violent hatred against me.**  
  
> 19	Protect my life and deliver me; \*  
let me not be put to shame, for I have trusted in you.  
> **20	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, \*  
for my hope has been in you.**  
  
> 21	Deliver Israel, O God, \*  
out of all his troubles.
