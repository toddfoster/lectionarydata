_Verba mea auribus_

> 1	Give ear to my words, O LORD; *
consider my meditation.
> **2	Hearken to my cry for help, my King and my God, *
for I make my prayer to you.**

> 3	In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; *
early in the morning I make my appeal and watch for you.
> **4	For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, *
and evil cannot dwell with you.**

> 5	Braggarts cannot stand in your sight; *
you hate all those who work wickedness.
> **6	You destroy those who speak lies; *
the bloodthirsty and deceitful, O LORD, you abhor.**

> 7	But as for me, through the greatness of your mercy I will go into your house; *
I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.
> **8	Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness,
because of those who lie in wait for me; *
make your way straight before me.**

> 9	For there is no truth in their mouth; *
there is destruction in their heart;
> **10	Their throat is an open grave; *
they flatter with their tongue.**

> 11	Declare them guilty, O God; *
let them fall, because of their schemes.
> **12	Because of their many transgressions cast them out, *
for they have rebelled against you.**

> 13	But all who take refuge in you will be glad; *
they will sing out their joy for ever.
> **14	You will shelter them, *
so that those who love your Name may exult in you.**

> 15	For you, O LORD, will bless the righteous; *
you will defend them with your favor as with a shield.
