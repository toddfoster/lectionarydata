_Dixit injustus_

> 1	There is a voice of rebellion deep in the heart of the wicked; *
there is no fear of God before his eyes.
> **2	He flatters himself in his own eyes *
that his hateful sin will not be found out.**

> 3	The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; *
he has left off acting wisely and doing good.
> **4	He thinks up wickedness upon his bed
and has set himself in no good way; *
he does not abhor that which is evil.**

> 5	Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, *
and your faithfulness to the clouds.
> **6	Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,
your justice like the great deep; *
you save both man and beast, O LORD.**

> 7	How priceless is your love, O God! *
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
> **8	They feast upon the abundance of your house; *
you give them drink from the river of your delights.**

> 9	For with you is the well of life, *
and in your light we see light.
> **10	Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *
and your favor to those who are true of heart.**

> 11	Let not the foot of the proud come near me, *
nor the hand of the wicked push me aside.
> **12	See how they are fallen, those who work wickedness! *
they are cast down and shall not be able to rise.**
