_Jubilate Deo_

> 1	Be joyful in the LORD, all you lands; \*  
serve the LORD with gladness  
and come before his presence with a song.  
> **2	Know this: The LORD himself is God; \*  
he himself has made us, and we are his;  
we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.**  
  
> 3	Enter his gates with thanksgiving;  
go into his courts with praise; \*  
give thanks to him and call upon his Name.  
> **4	For the LORD is good;  
his mercy is everlasting; \*  
and his faithfulness endures from age to age.**
