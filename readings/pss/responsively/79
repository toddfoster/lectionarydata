_Deus, venerunt_

> 1	O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance;  
they have profaned your holy temple; \*  
they have made Jerusalem a heap of rubble.  
> **2	They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the air, \*  
and the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts  
of the field.**  
  
> 3	They have shed their blood like water on every side of Jerusalem, \*  
and there was no one to bury them.  
> **4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors, \*  
an object of scorn and derision to those around us.**  
  
> 5	How long will you be angry, O LORD? \*  
will your fury blaze like fire for ever?  
> **6	Pour out your wrath upon the heathen who have not  
known you \*  
and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon  
your Name.**  
  
> 7	For they have devoured Jacob \*  
and made his dwelling a ruin.  
> **8	Remember not our past sins;  
let your compassion be swift to meet us; \*  
for we have been brought very low.**  
  
> 9	Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your Name; \*  
deliver us and forgive us our sins, for your Name's sake.  
> **10	Why should the heathen say, "Where is their God?" \*  
Let it be known among the heathen and in our sight  
that you avenge the shedding of your servants' blood.**  
  
> 11	Let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before you, \*  
and by your great might spare those who are condemned to die.  
> **12	May the revilings with which they reviled you, O Lord, \*  
return seven-fold into their bosoms.**  
  
> 13	For we are your people and the sheep of your pasture; \*  
we will give you thanks for ever  
and show forth your praise from age to age.
