_Laudate Dominum_

> 1	Hallelujah!  
How good it is to sing praises to our God! \*  
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!  
> **2	The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; \*  
he gathers the exiles of Israel.**  
  
> 3	He heals the brokenhearted \*  
and binds up their wounds.  
> **4	He counts the number of the stars \*  
and calls them all by their names.**  
  
> 5	Great is our LORD and mighty in power; \*  
there is no limit to his wisdom.  
> **6	The LORD lifts up the lowly, \*  
but casts the wicked to the ground.**  
  
> 7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; \*  
make music to our God upon the harp.  
> **8	He covers the heavens with clouds \*  
and prepares rain for the earth;**  
  
> 9	He makes grass to grow upon the mountains \*  
and green plants to serve mankind.  
> **10	He provides food for flocks and herds \*  
and for the young ravens when they cry.**  
  
> 11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; \*  
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;  
> **12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, \*  
in those who await his gracious favor.**  
  
> 13	Worship the LORD, O Jerusalem; \*  
praise your God, O Zion;  
> **14	For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; \*  
he has blessed your children within you.**  
  
> 15	He has established peace on your borders; \*  
he satisfies you with the finest wheat.  
> **16	He sends out his command to the earth, \*  
and his word runs very swiftly.**  
  
> 17	He gives snow like wool; \*  
he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.  
> **18	He scatters his hail like bread crumbs; \*  
who can stand against his cold?**  
  
> 19	He sends forth his word and melts them; \*  
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.  
> **20	He declares his word to Jacob, \*  
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.**  
  
> 21	He has not done so to any other nation; \*  
to them he has not revealed his judgments.  
Hallelujah!
