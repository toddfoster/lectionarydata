_Benedixisti, Domine_

> 1	You have been gracious to your land, O LORD, \*  
you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.  
> **2	You have forgiven the iniquity of your people \*  
and blotted out all their sins.**  
  
> 3	You have withdrawn all your fury \*  
and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.  
> **4	Restore us then, O God our Savior; \*  
let your anger depart from us.**  
  
> 5	Will you be displeased with us for ever? \*  
will you prolong your anger from age to age?  
> **6	Will you not give us life again, \*  
that your people may rejoice in you?**  
  
> 7	Show us your mercy, O LORD, \*  
and grant us your salvation.  
> **8	I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, \*  
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people  
and to those who turn their hearts to him.**  
  
> 9	Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, \*  
that his glory may dwell in our land.  
> **10	Mercy and truth have met together; \*  
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.**  
  
> 11	Truth shall spring up from the earth, \*  
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.  
> **12	The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, \*  
and our land will yield its increase.**  
  
> 13	Righteousness shall go before him, \*  
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.
