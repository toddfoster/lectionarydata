_Conserva me, Domine_

> 1	Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you; *
I have said to the LORD, "You are my Lord,
my good above all other."
> **2	All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land, *
upon those who are noble among the people.**

> 3	But those who run after other gods *
shall have their troubles multiplied.
> **4	Their libations of blood I will not offer, *
nor take the names of their gods upon my lips.**

> 5	O LORD, you are my portion and my cup; *
it is you who uphold my lot.
> **6	My boundaries enclose a pleasant land; *
indeed, I have a goodly heritage.**

> 7	I will bless the LORD who gives me counsel; *
my heart teaches me, night after night.
> **8	I have set the LORD always before me; *
because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.**

> 9	My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *
my body also shall rest in hope.
> **10	For you will not abandon me to the grave, *
nor let your holy one see the Pit.**

> 11	You will show me the path of life; *
in your presence there is fullness of joy,
and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.
